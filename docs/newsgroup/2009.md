## platonic flexagons
January 1, 2009

### Scott Sherman

Since New Years is a good time for idealism, I figured I would post some theoretical musings.

Consider the series of hexaflexagons made from straight strips of triangles.  Start with the 3-sided version, with its various faces and hinges.  Now consider the 6-sided hexaflexagon, which has all the same faces and hinges but adds new ones.  Stepping to the 12-sided variant, we again see all the same faces and hinges with new ones added.  Continuing this process an infinite number of times gives you a fractal made up of an infinite number of stacked triangles.  This fractal has been compared to a dragon curve (Harold V. McIntosh:  http://cellular.ci.ulsa.mx/comun/fxgonw/fxgon.html).  You can think of this infinite-sided hexaflexagon as an idealized "platonic hexaflexagon. "

You could create an infinite-sided hexaflexagon from other sequences as well, e.g. the sequence of braids (http://loki3.com/flex/braids.html).  An infinite braid would give you a different hexaflexagon however.  With a braided hexaflexagon, one side is different from the rest in that it can appear opposite all other sides when you do the Tuckerman traverse while all other sides only appear opposite three different sides.

* Conjecture 1:  All hexaflexagons, both finite and infinite, are a subset of the platonic hexaflexagon.

No matter where you're exploring in the platonic hexaflexagon, there are only a finite number of faces and hinges accessible in a given configuration.  However many times you use the pinch flex, there will always be exactly four pinch flexes you can perform from any position, two on one side and two from the opposite side.  This should be clear from looking at the state diagram of any finite hexaflexagon because there's a maximum of four lines coming off any node in the diagram.

* Conjecture 2:  A pinch flex transforms the platonic hexaflexagon into a structurally identical arrangement of faces and edges.  In other words, if you don't label the faces, the before and after states are indistinguishable.

I was trying various flexes on a 12-sided straight-strip hexaflexagon (e.g. the v-flex, pyramid shuffle and tuck flex - see http://loki3.com/flex/flex/index.html).  I'll refer to a flex that transforms a hexaflexagon from one hexagon configuration to another as a "hexagon flex" to distinguish it from flexes such as the pocket flex that don't.  I found that, for each hexagon flex, there was a configuration of the hexaflexagon where I could start from a position that allowed four pinch flexes, apply the flex and end up back in a configuration that allowed four pinch flexes.  This messes up the sides of course, but it led me to a stronger conclusion.

* Conjecture 3:  Any hexagon flex transforms the platonic hexaflexagon into a structurally identical arrangement of faces and edges.

## Several hexaflexagon related theorems and conjectures
January 12, 2009

### Yaacov Belenky

Hi everybody,

My name is Yaacov Belenky, I live in Israel, and I just found the Flexagon_Lovers group.  More than 30 years ago, when I was about 16-18 years old and lived in Moscow, I read about flexagons in Martin Gardner's books (in Russian translation) and then spent on flexagons at least several months, first to learn how to return back after V-flexes, and then to build some generalization of Tuckerman diagrams for flexagon states that appear after V-flexes. I never published this work. Last month my 18 years old daughter Miriam asked me to explain my theory to her. After I did, she urged me to let other people know about it. When I explained the theory to Miriam, I started to think more about it, and about a week ago I managed to prove the following two theorems.

**Definition.** A **regular state** of a flexagon is a state in which is has a rotational symmetry of order 3.

**Theorem 1.** If the same **straight** strip has been folded in two ways, producing two flexagon  in **regular** states A and B, then there exists a sequence of O(n) pinch flexes, V-flexes, rotations and flips that converts A to a state isomorphic to B, where n is the length of the strip.

(Of course, not all intermediate states in the sequence will be regular.)

Theorem 2 is a generalization of theorem 1, but with a worse upper limit for the sequence length .

**Theorem 2.** If **any** strip has been folded in two ways, producing two flexagon  in **regular** statesA and B, then there exists a sequence of O(n*n) pinch flexes, V-flexes,rotations and flips that converts A to a state isomorphic to B, where n is the length of the strip.

I have also two conjectures that I believe to be correct but presently don't know to prove.

**Conjecture 1.** If the same **straight** strip has been folded in two ways, producing two flexagon  in any (not necessarily regular) states A and B, then there exists a sequence of pinch flexes, V-flexes, rotations and flips that converts A to a state isomorphic to B.

(Note that the strip may be such that the flexagon has no regular states at all, e.g. if n = 3  or 6 mod 9.)

**Conjecture 2.** In theorem 2 the upper limit may be improved to O(n).

Regarding the most general form of the theorem (any strip and any states), it cannot be proven because it is false - I have a counterexample. I believe however that the vast majority of the states folded from the same arbitrary strip can be converted one to another, but presently don't have a characterization of this subset, not to speak about a proof.

I will be glad to share the theory and the proofs with the flexagon community, although it may take some time to write them down (I never did it).

### Scott Sherman

Welcome Yaacov,

Interesting work.  We've had a few conjectures on which flexes are sufficient for exploring a flexagon, but no proofs.  I like how you use the definition of regular state to confine what the flexes need to accomplish.  It's interesting that the pinch flex and v-flex are sufficient for transforming between those states.  The first I heard of the v-flex transforming between two regular states was when Robin Moseley mentioned that it worked for the 7-sided version (http://flexagon.net/).  I wonder what other sets of flexes would be sufficient?  Or, given that the v-flex doesn't work on triangle flexagons other than the hexaflexagon, what sets of flexes work in the more general case (pinch & tuck?).

In looking at your conjectures, my first guess is that the pinch flex and v-flex are not sufficient.  When we were looking into the minimum set of flexes needed to fully explore a point flexagon (http://www.loki3.com/flex/point-flexagon.html), we found that as you add sides you occasionally need to add new flexes.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQ_I4_N3sE&feature=channel_page shows some more flexes you can do on a hexaflexagon (also described at http://www.loki3.com/flex/flex/index.html).  My guess would be that a flex such as the slot flex opens up possibilities that you can't get to with just the pinch flex and v-flex.

### Yaacov Belenky

Scott,

Thank you for your useful remarks and links. In particular, the video is great; from it, with help of my daughter Miriam, I learned how to perform slot flex.

Till now I studied only hexaflexagons and tetraflexagons (the latter ones - only 30 years ago; I did not refresh them in my memory recently yet), so I presently have no opinion which kinds of flexes are necessary for other kinds of flexagons. However, in hexaflexagons the slot flex, tuck flex, and pyramid shuffle add nothing to the combination of pinch and v-flexes. I can say even more.

**Definition.** Two states are **pinch equivalent** if it is possible to move from one to the second using only pinch flexes.

**Definition.** Any equivalence class of states by pinch equivalence is called a **pinch class**.

**Definition.** Two pinch classes A and B are called **v-adjacent** if there exist states a from A and b from B and a v-flex that transforms a to b.

**Definition.** The **v-distance** between two pinch classes A and B is the minimal n such that there exists a sequence of n+1 pinch classes X[0]=A, X[1],...,X[n] +B, such that any two adjacent classes in this sequence are v-adjacent.

**Theorem 3.** If a tuck flex / pyramid shuffle / slot flex transform state a to state b, then the v-distance between their pinch classes is 1 / 1 / 2, correspondingly.

In the meantime, I came out with the following conjecture that I believe to be true and that that is the last generalization of my theorems for hexaflexagons.

**Definition.** A state is called **singular** is no pinch or v-flexes are possible from this state.

Conjecture 3. If the same strip (not necessarily straight) has been folded in two ways, producing two flexagon  in any **non-singular** states A and B, then there exists a sequence of pinch flexes, V-flexes, rotations and flips that converts A to a state isomorphic to B.

(Flexagons folded from a straight strip have no singular states, so Conjecture 2 follows from Conjecture 3. And no one can expect singular states to be connected.)

Do you think you have a counterexample? If yes, you (and everybody else) are welcome to challenge me!

Good flexing!

### Scott Sherman

Yaacov,

In the video of the 5-sided hexaflexagon, I show a slot flex that takes you to a singular state, i.e. you can't do a pinch flex or v-flex from that position.  The only possible hexagon-preserving flexes from here are a slot flex (the opposite of what put you in that state) and a pyramid shuffle.  The pyramid shuffle takes you to a third state, also singular, where the only possible flex is the pyramid shuffle that takes you back to the previous hexagon.

That said, is there an unstated assumption behind what you list as Theorem 3?  I used the slot flex to take me to a state b that isn't v-adjacent to the original state a.  And then I used the pyramid shuffle to take me to a third state c that isn't v-adjacent to either one.

On conjecture 3, if you strengthen the prerequisites to any **regular** states A and B, it seems more likely to be true.  I was playing with a complex set of pocket flexes and slot flexes on the 7-sided braid (aka "fan") and found a position where there were 3 states in the pinch class.  There was one possible v-flex you could do from one of those states, but you couldn't do any pinch flexes from the resulting state.  There was no way to pinch or v-flex back to the original flexagon.  Unfortunately the sequence of flexes I used is difficult to explain in words.

    [YB] I managed to perform the flexes that you describe in the paragraph above. Indeed my Theorem 3 as I formulated it was wrong, and you gave a counterexample; thank you for pointing this out. The theorem is still correct for your "platonic flexagon" or in any case close enough to it, i.e. whenever all relevant pats are thick enough. I need to study these kinds of flexes deeper to make my statement precise.

That said, is there an unstated assumption behind what you list as Theorem 3? I used the slot flex to take me to a state b that isn't v-adjacent to the original state a. And then I used the pyramid shuffle to take me to a third state c that isn't v-adjacent to either one.

    [YB] I guess, also somewhere around singular states?

    [YB] For regular states I know to prove it. I am now writing the proofs down; I guess it'll take me several more days before I can upload it.

    [YB] Do you prohibit to flip the flexagon to upside down? Because if not, any v-flex may be reverted by a flip, another v-flex and flip. I see that in http://math.georgiasouthern.edu/~bmclean/flex/powerpoints/MAA2007.ppt Bruce McLean does not use flip, but it seems to me somewhat unnatural.

Unfortunately the sequence of flexes I used is difficult to explain in words.

    [YB] It is possible to use Bruce's notation from the applet at http://math.georgiasouthern.edu/~bmclean/flex/index.html (P for pinch, V for v, R for rotate left, r for rotate right, adding also F for flip).

### Scott Sherman

I was looking further into some of the flexes and found an interesting result.  For each of the four flexes - pinch flex, v-flex, tuck flex and pyramid shuffle - it's possible to create a flexagon that allows only that single flex and none of the other 3 (surprisingly, a minimum of 9 leaves is required for each).  I'll post more on this later, but the conclusion to draw from this is that each of those flexes does something unique, so any statement about only needing a subset of those flexes to explore all states of a hexaflexagon would have to be explicit about the what types of flexagons and states are included in the statement, e.g. referring to just the "regular" states.

As for the slot flex and a description of the sequence I was referring to, I should point out that my use of the term "slot flex" isn't nearly as well-defined as with the other flexes.  In fact I see it as more of a technique than as a single flex.  Typically I'll start with one or more pocket flexes, find a slot I can slide a portion of the flexagon through one or more times, and possibly continue alternating between pocket flexes and sliding leaves through slots.  Once you accept that a flex doesn't have to immediately take you back to a hexagon, you can wonder around quite a lot this way, visiting all sorts of interesting intermediate shapes and sometimes leading you to a different hexagon state.  The particular sequence I mentioned involves 4 pocket flexes and sliding a leaf through a slot 4 times.  I have a notation I use to describe it, but it's visual rather than textual.  When I have some spare time I may post that as well.

In answer to the question of whether I allow the flexagon to be turned over, clearly I have one of the more liberal definitions of what a flex is, so flipping is definitely allowed ;)

### Yaacov Belenky

Scott,

I was interested in your statementthat "each of the four flexes - pinch
flex, v-flex, tuck flex and pyramid shuffle - it's possible to create a
flexagon that allows only that single flex and none of the other 3
(surprisingly, a minimum of 9 leaves is required for each)". I knew that
the minimal v-flaxable flexagon has 9 leaves, but I never studied deeply
the other 3 kinds of flexes. I did not deal with the slot flex and
pyramid shuffle yet, but when I looked into the tuck flex I received
different results.

Namely, as far as I can see, the minimal tuck-flexable flexagon has 10
leaves, and if they are numbered from 1 to 10 along the strip, the pats
are (10 1) (2) (3) (5 6 4) (8 7) (9) (state A). After tucking pats (3)
and (5 6 4) inside I receive (1) (3 4 2) (5) (7 6) (8) (10 9) (state B).
On the other hand, by flip + v-flex + flip I reach (2 1) (4) (6 5) (7)
(9 8) (10) (state C), which is pinch equivalent to state B. If we glue
together leaves 5 and 6, we receive the minimal v-flexable flexagon.

Moreover, the minimal v-flexable flexagon has just two states, each one
reachable from the other by a v-flex, i.e. the v-flex is invertible. The
minimal tuck-flexable flexagom has 5 states, and only two pairs of them
are connected by tuck flexes - each pair in one direction only, i.e. the
tuck flex is not invertible!

Please let me know if you see a mistake in my results. Maybe we
understand tuck flex differently? I think I do whst is shown in you
video...

### Scott Sherman

Hmmm.  I'm not sure what the shape of your strip is, but perhaps you could try pasting together leaves 8 and 7.  Then fold it in half between pats (5 4 6) and (7), which is also between pats (10 1) and (2).  Open it up from the center and tuck (4 5) and (6 7 8) into the middle (noting that opening it up transferred leaf 6 to a different pat).  (Though the fact that you said (5 6 4) probably means that the shape is subtly different from what I was thinking it was.)

If I misunderstood and that doesn't work, try the following:

```
++++-++--
11222b122
2aa11ccb1
```

This uses Conrad and Hartline's notation for a flexagon strip.  Each column describes a leaf, with the top number going on one side and the bottom number on the other.  The +'s and -'s describe which direction the next leaf should go in.  I think this notation makes more sense when the strip has been folded up into a single triangle than when it's sitting in its unfolded state, but it has some good uses.  (I've also seen RLRL used to describe the unfolded state.)  Basically ++++++ is a straight strip and +-+-+- is a hexagon.  http://cellular.ci.ulsa.mx/comun/flexagon/node5.html has more details.  Once you make the strip (which I'll post when I've got a chance), fold c on c, b on b and a on a.  There will be exactly one place where you can perform a tuck flex.

Yes, I agree - the v-flex is its own inverse and the tuck flex is not (a fact I didn't realize till I created the minimal flexagon above).  You can do the tuck flex in reverse if you're careful, but it's not a graceful move.  When you use the minimal tuck flex flexagon, you can only do a single tuck flex and the only way out of the new state is to do the tuck flex in reverse.  The pinch flex and pyramid shuffle are also their own inverses.

#### Bendy gadget future for graphene
By Jason Palmer
Science and Technology reporter, BBC News

Graphene graphic (SPL)
A pencil's 'lead' is primarily graphite, made up of millions of sheets of graphene

**A remarkable material called graphene could soon be used to make flexible and transparent high-speed electronics, researchers say.**

Graphene's incredible mechanical and electronic properties are well known, but it is difficult to make in bulk.

It consists of one-atom-thick layers of carbon atoms arranged in hexagons.

A report in the journal Nature is the third in recent efforts that have seen the production of centimetre-scale samples of graphene.

The transparent samples can be fixed to any surface and bent or twisted without damaging them.

When the technique is perfected, such films could be used in solar cells as well as any number of bendy, thin, transparent gadgetry, such as crystal-clear, flexible displays.

**Getting lead out**

First discovered in 2004, graphene is a close cousin of carbon nanotubes, which are in effect graphene rolled up.

Tiny, high-quality samples of graphene can be sourced by using sticky tape to simply pull them off graphite - the same stuff that is in a pencil lead.

Transistors made from such samples have been shown to operate at gigahertz frequencies - comparable to the speed of modern computers. The material could theoretically operate near terahertz frequencies, hundreds of times faster.

The samples also have remarkable mechanical strength, because the bond that carbon atoms form between themselves is one of the strongest known.

> It's a really important development
>
> Andre Geim, University of Manchester

And it gets even better: because they are so thin, the sheets are practically transparent.

**Under the sheets**

However, for wider application, graphene must be made in larger sheets while maintaining the high quality of the smaller samples.

A suggestion first proposed a few years ago is now coming to fruition: evaporating a mixture of large carbon-containing molecules and firing it over a heated metal surface.

The molecules break down, releasing carbon that re-organises on the surface in neat graphene sheets. The precise conditions of the experiment determine how many sheets are produced.

While growth of such films on metal surfaces has been known to happen for decades, no one had been able to remove the films from the metal, and no one knew if graphene, once removed, would maintain its spectacular potential.

Now, Byung Hee Hong at Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul, South Korea, and colleagues have applied the technique to produce films of up to 12 sheets on extremely thin pieces of nickel.

By dissolving away the nickel with chemicals, the researchers were left with graphene films they could stick to a flexible polymer called PET.

The researchers went on to show that because the films are so robust, they maintain their striking electronic properties even when bent and twisted.

**Great minds**

The work confirms that the approach is the most promising path towards bendy, practically invisible electronics. In December, Jing Kong of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) published the first account of successfully producing graphene films using the nickel technique.
Nanotube (SPL)
Graphene offers much of the promise of carbon nanotubes, in sheet form

They showed that the precise structure of the graphene films they produced could be controlled by putting a nanometre-scale pattern on the thin nickel plates.

Earlier in January, Yong Chen led a group from Purdue University, US, that published a paper on the arXiv website detailing the approach.

After production, their films were deposited onto silicon-based substrates, showing a potential means to supplement existing microelectronics with the terrifying speed of graphene components.

Andre Geim, whose group first discovered graphene and demonstrated its potential for electronics, is impressed with the recent flood of demonstrations.

"It's a really important development, " Professor Geim, who is based at the University of Manchester, told BBC News.

"It took five years from our demonstration of the beautiful properties of isolated graphene and now, at last, three groups have demonstrated that it's possible."

However, he notes that the samples produced using the new technique are so far relatively disordered and made of regions of differing numbers of graphene layers.

For the speediest electronics, only a single layer like that acquired with sticky tape will do.

"Until now, everyone has been using our so-called 'pencil technique' (the sticky-tape method) but the disadvantage is that the graphite crystals are quite small - it's really painstaking research," Professor Geim explained.

Widespread availability of larger, high-quality graphene films will vastly speed up research into the material's properties, putting researchers ever closer to real applications.

"This technique shows the missing element for the whole story, from finding graphene to making real transistors because it shows that industrial scale production is possible," Andre Geim said.

## Martin Gardner Book
January 22, 2009

### Ann Schwartz

HEXAFLEXAGONS, PROBABILITY PARADOXES, AND THE TOWER OF HANOI by
Martin Gardner, revised edition, is now available on Amazon. The
publisher is Cambridge University Press.

The first chapter is on hexaflexagons and the new postscript and
bibliography include references to a number of people in this user
group: Les Pook, myself, Ela Schwartz, Jean Pedersen, David Mitchell,
Frank Bernhart, and Phil Mitchell.

Les, he calls your book "a marvelous survey of flexagon theory,
covering a wide variety of flexagons... " (I'd get Gardner's
persmission to use that quote on the cover of your next book,
attributing it, of course, to Martin Gardner on Flexagons Inside Out.)

Amazon has its "Search Inside" available for this book, so you can
look up your name.

I also requested permission from Cambridge University Press to scan
and post the postscript and bibliography for the flexagon chapter in
the files section of this user group. I'll let the group know when
and if that comes through.

Jeff (Rutzky), I'll sorry but your name is misspelled in the book to
the point of being unrecognizable. I notified my contact at Cambridge
University Press about this.

### Les Pook

Ann

Thanks for the information. I've ordered a copy of Martin Gardner's
book, and will add it to the references in my new book. The
manuscript is nearly ready to send to Springer.

Do you know when 'Homage to a pied puzzler' will be published? Amazon
tell me that publication has been delayed. I'd like to cite the book
as a reference, but need to see it first.

Anyone who wants to try it should note that one of the features
of 'Look Inside', that is available on Amazon.com, is not available
on Amazon.co.uk. This is because of copyright issues.

### Ann Schwartz

Hi Les,

The last time I spoke to someone at A K Peters, the contact told me that the book would
be printing in late Janurary. So it's time for me to call them again, and then post the news.

In the meantime, I did yet permission to reprint pages from the Gardner book, and will be
applying my puny computer skills to posting the pages mentioned earlier.

## basic flexes
January 24, 2009

### Scott Sherman

The most basic flex on a triangle flexagon is the pocket flex.  It's the only flex that can be done on all triangle flexagons, down to the simplest 6 leaf triangle tetraflexagon.  It demonstrates the basic flexagon behavior of transferring leaves between pats.  It's also the basic component of several other flexes, with a series of pocket flexes even serving as a replacement for the pinch flex.

The pinch flex requires at least 9 leaves (e.g. the trihexaflexagon) , so you might figure it's the next simplest flex after the pocket flex.  But what's interesting is that the v-flex, tuck flex and pyramid shuffle can all be performed on a 9 leaf flexagon as well, though with different flexagons in each case.

The pinch flex, v-flex and tuck flex all require a minimum of 3 hinges while the pyramid shuffle requires 4.  However, the pyramid shuffle only requires 5 pats while the others require 6, thus the pyramid shuffle can be done on a triangle pentaflexagon with 9 leaves whereas the others require a minimum of a hexaflexagon with 9 leaves.

I've included the simplest flexagon for each of these flexes on the pages where I describe the flexes.  The v-flex can be found at http://loki3.com/flex/flex/v.html, the tuck flex at http://loki3.com/flex/flex/tuck. html and the pyramid shuffle at http://loki3.com/flex/flex/pyramid-shuffle.html.

I've also included a flexagon specifically designed for doing a series of tuck flexes.  Flexagons are generally built specifically for the pinch flex, but this isn't a necessity.  There are actually more possible flexagons than the typical count of flexagons per number of sides would indicate.

## Transformations between flexagons
January 17, 2009

### Les Pook

I have followed recent postings on transformations between apparently distinct types of flexagons, that can be folded from the same net, with considerable interest. There are some further examples in my forthcoming book, but I haven't been able to draw any general conclusions, beyond the obvious fact that the torsion (number of half twists around a flexagon) must be the same for a transformation to be possible.

Postings by Jaacov and Scott address the question of finding flexes that can be used to perform transformations. Some flexes, such as simple flexes for point flexagons, and pinch flexes, can be carried out without bending the leaves, and leaves can be regarded as rigid and of zero thickness. If the leaves are rigid and of zero thickness then a flexagon is a mechanism. Some mechanisms are locked, that is there are positions (states) that cannot be reached from a given starting position without disconnecting a hinge, reassembling it in a desired position, and reconnecting the hinge. Some flexagons behave like this.

Some flexes require leaf bending, and a pragmatic approach is to regard as legitimate any flex that can be carried out on a paper model. Paper approximates to an inextensible, flexible material of zero thickness. If flexagons are made from sufficiently flexible material (which paper isn't) then a transformation would always be possible provided that the torsion is the same. Whether or not a particular flex is possible sometimes depends on what sort of paper is used. I use origami paper when a lot of leaf bending is needed.

In general, flexagons are simple bands, but some point flexagons are knotted bands. This is an additional complication for transformations between point flexagons that I haven't explored. I don't know of any edge flexagons that are knotted bands.

Jaacov, welcome aboard. I look forward to seeing your proof in detail. Last year Robin Moseley came across a Russian article on flexagons (Postings 471-475). We managed to follow some of the diagrams but no one knew enough Russian to read the text. Could you tell us what it's all about?

### Yaacov Belenky

Les,

I hope to upload an article with proofs on my theorems in a week or two.

Regarding the article in Russian: First of all, it is a continuation of
a series of articles, and one of the cited articles is from 1975, so
this article is not before 1975. Besides the schemes, I found nothing
particularly interesting in this article; it mostly refers to the
previous ones that I don't have a way to access. Actually around 1975 I
was both subscribed to this magazine and interested in flexagons, but I
don't remember this series of articles, which probably means that it
contained nothing essential beyond what I could learn from Martin
Gardner's articles.

I found also references to two articles in Russian in the magazine
"Quantum" from 1995 and 1996; they are available on the Internet, but I
did not check them yet.

### Scott Sherman

So for the nets that produce multiple flexagons, do all such variants always have the same torsion, or can they be different?  (Other than the obvious mirrored version for some nets.)

The question of whether to consider flexes that require bending the leaves is an interesting one, but since many of the flexes can be done without bending on different flexagons, I feel better about using them even when bending is required.  The tuck flex requires a lot of bending on a hexaflexagon, but can be done without bending on a star dodecaflexagon.  The pyramid shuffle requires bending on a hexaflexagon, but can be done without bending on an isosceles triangle octaflexagon.  And on the flip side, while a pinch flex can be done on a hexaflexagon without bending, there are times when it requires pretty severe bending on a star dodecaflexagon.  The only flex I use that seems to always require bending is the v-flex but then I haven't been able to generalize it beyond equilateral triangle flexagons.  And the only flex that never requires bending is the very basic pocket flex.

Of course, as Les points out, unlimited bending would allow all sorts of transformations so I haven't really come up with any hard and fast rules for what should be valid and what not.  I think a good analogy would be number theory.  There are plenty of interesting numbers to explore if you just limit yourself to addition and subtraction of whole numbers.  Including multiplication and division opens up the extra possibilities of the rational numbers.  Adding in powers and roots gives you irrationals and complex numbers.  Any subset is perfectly valid for exploration but so is including more possibilities.

Yes, flexagon variants folded from the same net can have different
torsion. The flexagons shown in Figures 6.1 and 6.25 of 'Flexagons
inside out' are an example, and there are many others.

A useful concept when considering leaf bending is that of the
curvature of an edge hinged ring of polygons. The curvature is
defined as the angle deficit at the centre of the ring. For a ring of
6 equilateral triangles the sum of the angles at the centre of the
ring is 360 deg and the curvature is zero. For a ring of four
equilateral triangles the curvature is 120 deg, and for 8 equilateral
triangles it is -120 deg. The curvature is a topological invariant,
and the idea is borrowed from Gaussian curvature in differential
geometry.

My own feeling is that what flexes should be regarded as legitimate
is a matter of taste. Initially I felt that leaf bending shouldn't be
allowed but I now feel that this is much too restrictive since some
amusing flexes are not allowed, and a systematic approach to
flexagons is more difficult.

I like the analogy with number theory. In both number theory and
flexagons some of the underlying mathematics is difficult, but it is
possible to make significant discoveries without much mathematical
background.

### Scott Sherman

Ah yes, of course.  We also found that many nets for point flexagons generated flexagons with different torsion.  I guess I was specifically wondering about hexaflexagons that might have a bearing on some of Yaacov's conjectures.  Since you can v-flex between the two different flexagons produced by that one 7-sided variant (the last pair listed at http://www.flexagon.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=30&Itemid=35), those must have the same torsion.  But as the number of sides goes up, the number of strips with multiple foldings goes up quickly, so it seems like there's a chance you might run into variants you couldn't v-flex between.

### Ann Schwartz

Hi Les,

I'm not sure if this is what you're discussing below, but there are many flexagons that can
be made using the same strip (or template or freize) shown on Eighthsquare. com. (Is net
the right term?) This straight strip of "bronze" (30-60-90 degree triangles) can, of course,
be folded into a hexa-dodecaflexagon , which is hexagon composed of 12 bronze
triangles. However, the strip can also be folded into these flexagons. Many of them exhibit
the "toggle triangles" that shift the faces into different modes exhibited by the dodeca.

*Triangle flexagons. These are equilateral triangles composed of 6 bronze triangles, very
much like the ones on Scott Sherman's site. But these triangle flex into flat states. If you
cut the strip shown on hexa-dodeca strip exactly in half, you can fold a triangle that has
four faces. If you use the whole strip, you get a triangle with eight faces. Plus, like in the
dodeca, the bronze component triangles mix faces in an orderly fashion, so that there are
additional faces, so to speak. Interestingly enough, the gray triangles stay hidden. I think
the grey triangles are necessary in order to get flat states when you flex.

*The hollow hexagon. Start with the straight strip, and follow the directions on Eighthsquare. com. When you form a hollow hexagon--pretty early in the process, stop.
This hollow hexagon flexes. Pinch flex along three equidistant corners and you'll get a
propeller shape: a large equilateral triangle made of 18 bronze triangles with three
bronze triangles sticking out like propellers at each corner. Some of these states have only
two propellers. Some of these shapes can be flexed down into a hexagon and flexed like
the dodeca.

*Large triangle flexagon. You can also take the same strip and make a large equilateral
triangle made of 18 triangles (with no propellers). It flexes into pinwheel hexagons, and
can flex down into a hexagon that flexes.

*Six-pointed star flexagon. If you join two of the strips end to end, you can get a six-
pointed star flexagon. I think Scott has something similar on his site. This one flexes into
hexagonal pinwheels and triangle pinwheels. It can flex down into a dodeca. And there's
one flex that turns the whole thing chaotic--you end up with a ball of paper.

Using silver (45-45-90 degree) triangles. Again, I think Scott has similar flexagons, but
these have different properties, I believe because I use straight strips.

*A super square: 16 triangles, a square within a square. Flexes into a square pinwheel with
toggle triangles. I have to use paper clips on this one, to force it to behave.

*A six-sided flexagon. I know I've seen this on Scott's site. Again, with a straight strip, you
get flat states. This mixes faces, but I haven't figured out how many basic faces it has.

Along with some other flexagons, I presented these at the last Gathering for Gardner.

Some discoveries of the dodeca flexagon being published in Homage to a Pied Puzzler:

*You can flex along the creases that run from the midpoints of the sides of the hexagon
to the center. Sometimes the flexagon will open up into an equilateral triangle made of six
bronze triangles. You'll be able to flex this triangle a couple of times, each time revealing
a new face.

*You can flex the dodeca along four equidistant creases and get surfaces that have
triangles from three different faces.

*You can flex it along axes that are 30 and 120 degrees apart. The flexagon will open up
into a large parallelogram. (I'm pretty sure that I have seen that other people have
discovered this, too.) But this parallelogram can be flexed. This the only maneuver in
which I have to force the leaves back a little. But you will get flat states, some with
triangles from 5 of the faces. Eventually, the parallelogram flexes into a cup that reveals,
at last, the gray triangles. All of the gray triangles on the strips can be exposed in this
way.

I hope this is helpful.

### Les Pook

Ann

Yes, this is the sort of thing I had in mind. My rather loose
definition is: 'Some flexagons exist in different forms with
different forms belonging to different families. For convenience,
individual forms are sometimes regarded as flexagons in their own
right and given separate names. A flex sequence that transforms one
form into another is a transformation between flexagons.'.

Personally, I prefer 'net' because its use is well established in the
literature on polyhedra, and extends naturally to flexagons. I think
of 'template' and 'frieze' as American English rather than British
English usage, but immediately understand the meaning.

I've got a copy of Martin Gardner's new book. He's done us proud.

## pentahexaflexagon in strange state
January 25, 2009

### discombobyoulater

Howdy,

I am rather a novice when it comes to flexagons. This weekend I printed out and
constructed Robin Moseley's Pentahexaflexgaon variation 1/1 (I don't recall where I found
it). I first did the usual flexes to travel the Tuckerman diagram given, so I think I have
folded it up correctly (though I believe there was a typo in the instructions, in that I ended
up gluing the backs of A6-D6, not A1-D6).

But I have now managed to get the thing into what to me seems a strange state. It is not a
flat hexagon but instead is two pyramids, each with a square base, sharing a common
triangular surface. From above the pyramids I see just the six A faces. Looking from
below the pyramids I see D3 D2 D1 D6 (clockwise) in one pyramid and E3 E4 E5 E6 in the
other. E3-D3 is the shared surface, though there are layers in between.

I am trying to figure out (a) how to get back to the original state, and (b) how I got into
this state in the first pace. For the latter, I started with face A up and folded it in half
(mountain crease), opened the crack along the top edge, and after that I'm not sure what I
did.

I've tried a few operations from the state it's in, but have had no luck. If I tug on D6-A6 I
can slide a triangle from between the two pyramids and one pyramid now has five
triangles, the other 3 (D3 D3 D1 D6 C6 and E3 E4 E5). I can also do the same by tugging
on E6-A5.

Oh... wait a sec. Just now I somehow managed to get it back to the flat hexagonal state.
But it is not in the original state. One face is A6 A5 A4 A3 D3 D2 and the other is A1 A2
E3 E4 E5 E6. Interesting.

Obviously this would be better with a video. But maybe this is old hat to people here.
Does anyone know how I would get this back to the original state?

Thanks for any help

### Scott Sherman

Hi Bob,

The way you got into the state where you had two pyramids was by doing a series of "pocket flexes."  You may have started doing a pinch flex (the standard flex) but only opened up one side into a pyramid rather than opening up all three.  From there you can keep opening up the pyramid until it's flat again.  Then you can open it up from the other side and repeat the process.  This will lead to the state you described where you had the D and E pyramids sharing a face.  You could have gotten out of this by flattening a pyramid and trying to open it from the former tip of the pyramid, repeating as necessary (and noting that a pyramid won't always open).  If you're just doing pocket flexes, you won't end up messing up the faces when you finally get back to a hexagon.

When you were sliding one triangle between the pyramids, you were doing a "slot flex."  This move mixes up the sides.

However, judging from your final state I'd guess what you did was the "pyramid shuffle."  To get out of that state, you need to do another pyramid shuffle.  Start by folding D2 onto D3 to make a pyramid with a flat set of triangles sticking off it.  Now open up the top of the pyramid by folding the pair of triangles labeled A1 and A2 down.  Keep pulling on that corner until B6 is against B3 and C2 is against C3.  Now find triangles A1 and A6 and the point they share with A3.  Grab that point and open it up toward the inside of the A3, A4, A5, A6 pyramid.  Fold together A5 and A6 while opening up a new pyramid with B1, B2, B3, B6 on the inside.  Take the tip shared by B1 and B2 and stuff it into the middle of the "cup."  It should now easily open up giving you all A's on one side and E's on the other side.  This is much easier to show that to describe in words.

I posted a video that shows these flexes on the pentahexaflexagon - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQ_I4_N3sE.  In the video, side A is red, B is blue, C is gray, D is green and E is purple.  You can find descriptions of various flexes at http://www.loki3.com/flex/flex/index.html.  If you're going to experiment with different flexes, it's easier to tape the sides together when you first make the flexagon (rather than pasting) so you can easily take it apart if you get too lost.

### Robin Moseley

I love the video that Scott posted!  I would not want to try to write out instructions and diagrams for all those flexes.  I notice the the You Tube views of 635 (and growing) are pretty good for this video.  It will not be viral, but there is clearly interest out there for flexagons.  Yes, there was a typo in the pentahexaflexagon template.  I believe it should now be corrected in the version on my website.  It would not be fun or challenging if the templates were perfect!

### discombobyoulater

Thanks, Scott.

The flexes to undo the contraption proved to be my undoing. I believe I made a mistake
along the way and ended up in yet another strange state. Since I had used tape to bind
the last two triangles during construction, I followed your second advice, deconstructed
the beast, and started over.

### Kathy Knapp

Scott,
That video is very helpful.  I have taught the flex, and only the flat state of changing colors.   So what we would have called mistakes, really were just parts of different states!  I need to spend lots of time learning more or at least encouraging the young students to learn more.  I will give them the youtube link and let them be curious beyond what they learned from me.

### Scott Sherman

Exactly.  I'm sure I've just assigned names to flexes people have stumbled across and ignored many times before.  For example, what I call a "tuck flex," Conrad and Hartline in their 1962 paper call a "distortion."  They describe it as "a relatively well known but much dreaded aspect of the flexagon."  Personally I think these other flexes add a new level of interesting states to explore.  Even the simple pentahexaflexagon, with only 7 states reachable with the pinch flex alone, has lots of new territory to explore once you add in more flexes.  And things get even more interesting when you try the flexes on other flexagons, such as the isosceles triangle dodecaflexagon - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsaEhpDgWd8&feature=channel_page.

I'd be interested to hear what your students come up with...

### Pauline Shreiman

Is there a video that shows how to make one of these? pauline

### Scott Sherman

I haven't posted one.  I doubt there's a video showing how to make an isosceles triangle dodecaflexagon but there may be one showing how to make a hexaflexagon.  However, I do have instructions on how to make that dodecaflexagon (and others) at http://www.loki3.com/flex/dodeca.html.

## Enantiomorphism in flexagons
February 11, 2009

### Les Pook

All flexagons exist as enantiomorphic (mirror image) pairs. Some  edge flexagons are twisted bands. A flexagon that is a twisted band must have an enantiomorph because the torsion can be either positive or negative. The two members of an enantiomorphic pair are not usually considered to be distinct types of flexagon but, if they are regarded as distinct, then the enantiomorph of a flexagon with numbered faces can be derived by interchanging the numbers on the faces of each leaf of its net. From a topological viewpoint it is not possible to transform between the two enantiomorphs because this is a 'nonperformable operation'. In other words, to transform between enantiomorphs, a hinge must be disconnected and the flexagon re-assembled as the other enantiomorph.

Some edge flexagons are untwisted bands, that is their torsion is zero. From a topological viewpoint this means that there is no enantiomorph. However, interchanging the numbers on each leaf of a net results in a flexagon that is an enantiomorph. If leaf bending is allowed, transforming between the forms with these enantiomorphic face numberings is a 'performable operation' that can, theoretically, be achieved without disconnecting a hinge. As far as I know, leaves always have to be bent, sometimes severely.

## Theory of hexaflexagons
February 3, 2009

### Yaacov Belenky

I uploaded file "Theory of hexaflexagons. pdf" to the Flexagon_Lovers files page. In this article I introduce the terminology that I use (where possible I stick to the terminology that seems to be standard) and prove the first theorem that I announced several weeks ago, namely that for any regular flexagon states (with rotational symmetry of order 3) folded from the same straight strip it is possible to transform one of them to another using a sequence of v-flexes, pinch flexes, rotations and flips, where the length of the sequence is linear in the strip length. My daughter Miriam read a significant part of the article, found several typos and added several notes that may help to read the article. The article is still a first draft; I am intending to add a proof of the second theorem (the same for any strip, with a worse upper limit for the sequence length) and maybe proofs of some statements that ai left without proof in the meantime. I will appreciate feedback and notification of typos and mistakes in the proofs from anyone willing to read the article.

### Les Pook

Yaacov

A welcome, elegant, addition to the literature on flexagons. Your
splitting procedure is equivalent to what I call a main position
link, where singletons are replaced by thick pats from another
flexagon. As you indicate, this sort of approach can be used to
design flexagons with desired properties.

There must be other people who, inspired by Martin Gardner, have
deveoped similar ideas independently. Incidentally, my first attempt
to publish some of my ideas was rejected with the sarcastic
comment 'Who wants to be an expert an flexagons?'. Quite a lot of
people do.

### Scott Sherman

Yaacov,

It'll take me awhile to digest all of that, though it's an intriguing result.  But in the meantime, a couple questions.  What's the intuitive explanation for what a pat formula represents?  And in the proof of fact 29, you state, "Since all segments have odd length..." - why is that so?  I assume this is a consequence of using a straight strip, since it's not true in general.

As to Les's point, Conrad & Hartline's '62 paper also describes a leaf-splitting method for creating flexagons.  As I was thinking about it, I realized it put to rest one of my concerns over different foldings possibly having different twists and hence being inaccessible from each other.  Splitting leaves preserves the overall twist of the flexagon, so, unlike the point flexagons Les & I were looking at awhile back, all edge flexagons have the same twist (once you decide right or left handed).

Of course, when presented with a conclusion like what's in that paper, I immediately start wondering how to generalize it.  Does it work for general hexaflexagons beyond just ones from straight strips?  I would guess you could use the tuck flex in place of the v-flex and get the same results, which would be nice since the v-flex doesn't generalize beyond the standard equilateral triangle hexaflexagon.  So perhaps you could use a combination of the pinch flex and tuck flex on other triangle flexagons in a similar fashion?  And since this result is for "regular" hexaflexagons, what flexes are required in general for exploring all non-regular states, or is that even possible without too much deformation?  Plenty to keep us busy...

### Yaacov Belenky

Les,

I agree  that it is very likely that other people developed similar ideas independently. In fact, I was too sure that's the case, and that's why I never published my results until my daughter urged me to check whether they were publicly known. From a brief review of the results on the Web I received an impression that central points of my theory are not publicly known, namely:

* Alternative interpretation of the Tuckerman traverse as a description of structure of the pats (Tuckerman map)
* Generalization of Tuckerman maps to irregular states (without rotational symmetry of order 3). In this case Tuckerman map and Tuckerman traverse are different - namely, the Tuckerman traverse is a subset of the Tuckerman map consisting of edges covered 3 times
* Description of action of the V-flex on the Tuckerman map (two edge lengths change by +2,-2  - see details in my article)
* The theorems that I recently announced, and proved the first one in the article (proofs of the other two theorems to appear in the next version)

It may happen that I missed something; in this case I'd appreciate if you (or anyone else) would refer me to similar published ideas.

By the way, in the third theorem (all flexagon states, not necessarily regular, folded from a **straight** strip, are V-equivalent) , it comes out that there is an exception - for a 12-leaf straight strip, there are 2 V-classes (and no regular states). For all other straight strips, however, there is only one V-class.

### Yaacov Belenky

Scott,

1) Regarding intuitive explanation of pat formula. A pat formula is a sequence of numbers corresponding to connecting edges. Each number means, in a sense, what is the "distance" between the two leaves connected by this connecting edge. I can explain the meaning of this "distance" in the following two informal ways:

    a) Let's produce the pat from a singleton by a sequence of splittings. In the first splitting in which an edge becomes a connecting edge, it receives number 1. Any subsequent splitting of a leaf adjacent to this edge increments the number by 1. The final number is the total number of splittings "between" the two leaves adjacent to the edge;

    b) In a regular flexagon state, the Tuckerman traverse includes rotations by 60 degrees. If we look at the maximal subsequence of pinch flexes without rotations between them, 3 out of 6 pat connecting edges will remain pat connecting edges throughout the entire subsequence. In the beginning, one of the leaves adjacent to this connecting edge will be s singleton (in every third of the flexagon); in the end of the subsequence, the other adjacent edge will be a singleton. The "distance" between these edges is the number of pinch flexes without rotations between these two states.

Of course, the two explanations are interconnected.

2) Regarding my statement that "Since all segments have odd length...". It follows from Theorem 1 that states: "If b is the number corresponding to a connecting edge in the strip formula of a flexagon state, and f is the number corresponding to the same connecting edge in the flexagon state formula, then b = f mod 2", and from the fact that strip formula of a straight strip is all 1's. I'll write this statement ("All segments have odd lengths for a flaxagon state folded from a straight strip") as a separate Fact in the next version of the article. If you find any other missing steps in my proofs – please let me know.

3) Regarding your statement that "all edge flexagons have the same twist (once you decide right or left handed)". I did not deal with square flexagons recently, but I remember that a long time ago I did fold a square flexagon which was not twisted at all (an equal number of left and right handed twists).

4) Regarding your question whether it generalizes to arbitrary strips and non-regular states – I know to generalize to each one of them, but not to the both of them combined. Namely, all regular states folded from the same arbitrary strip belong to the same V-class; and all (not necessarily regular) states folded from a straight strip belong to the same V-class – except for the straight strip with 12 leaves, for which it is 2 V-classes! The proofs are a little trickier than the first one, particularly for the arbitrary states; I am adding them now to the article. Speaking about arbitrary states folded from arbitrary strips – it is clear that there are many isolated states from which no flexes are available. Intuitively I expect that all non-isolated states folded from the same strip belong to the same V-class, probably with some exceptions for short enough strips (like the exception of the straight strip with 12 leaves). But presently I have no idea how to prove it (if it is correct at all).

5) Regarding your point about tuck flex instead of v-flex –  I think it can work. I want to look into it once I'm finished with writing down my results.

### Scott Sherman

Yes, on point #3 I had overstated my case, so I'll rephrase it.  It looks to me like face splitting preserves twist.  You can generate all hexaflexagons (for example) through face splitting.  Therefore they must all have the same twist (after the first face splitting decides left versus right-handed).  I had wondered if different foldings might have different twists, preventing you from flexing between them.  This would suggest the answer is no.

So perhaps for a square flexagon you split opposite faces at the same time, leaving you with no twist?

## minimal slot-flex hexaflexagon
February 15, 2009

### Scott Sherman

Next I wanted to see what the slot flex adds to the mix.  I started with a 5-sided hexaflexagon (from http://loki3.com/flex/braids.html, but numbered 1-5 instead of 0-4), performed the slot flex I showed in the video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQ_I4_ N3sE), and marked every triangle face necessary for doing the flex.  Taping together the triangles that aren't needed (a pair of 5's, a pair of 4's and a pair of 2's), gives you a 12-leaf hexaflexagon.  This is the minimum number of leaves necessary for this flex (though there's another 12-leaf strip that also works).

After you do the slot flex on this 12-leaf hexaflexagon, you end up in a state that allows no other flexes beyond the reverse slot:  no pinch flex, no v-flex, no tuck or inverse tuck, and no pyramid shuffle.  But if you skip taping together the pair of 2's, you can do a pyramid shuffle from here that takes you to a third state.  The only flex you can perform here is the pyramid shuffle that takes you back to the second state.

(Actually, if you use that other 12-leaf strip I mentioned, you can perform the slot flex followed by the pyramid shuffle without having to add a leaf back.  It's identical to the first strip except that you paste a pair of 3's together instead of the pair of 2's.)

The 11-leaf flexagon I previously discussed demonstrates that the tuck flex can get you to states the others can't.  This 12-leaf flexagon shows that the slot flex and pyramid shuffle can open up new states as well.  The minimal 9-leaf flexagons for the pinch flex, v-flex, tuck flex and pyramid shuffle are trivial examples where each of those flexes get you to states the others can't, but it's nice to see this in more complex flexagons as well.

## Linear time algorithm that decides whether a strip can be folded to a flexagon
March 5, 2009

### Yaacov Belenky

The algorithm described below is another (and less heavy) application of the "strip formula" notation that I introduced in my article "Theory of Hexaflexagons.pdf".

For those who did not read my article: for a strip that can be folded to a flexagon, the **strip formula** is a cyclic sequence of 0’s and 1’s, each digit corresponding to an edge common to two leaves (a **connecting edge**), where the digit is 0 if this connecting edge and two neighbor connecting edges (the previous and the next ones) have all a common point, and 1 otherwise. Equivalently, the digit is 1 if the four leaves – two before the edge and two after it – form a straight substrip, and 0 otherwise. Splitting a leave corresponds to flipping the two digits corresponding to its two connecting edges, plus insertion of digit 1 between them, which corresponds to the new connecting edge that results from the splitting.

**Definition**. An **even formula** is a cyclic sequence of 0’s and 1’s with an even number of 0’s.

**Lemma 1**. Any strip formula is even.

**Proof**. By induction. The strip formula 000000 of the trivial flexagon is even. It is easy to see that splitting preserves the parity of the number of 0’s.

**Definition**. A **signed even formula** G corresponding to an even formula F is a cyclic sequence of 0’s, 1’s and -1’s, where the absolute values in G are the same as in F, and the sign of two non-zero elements is the same if and only if the number of 0’s between them is even (in other words, after each zero the sign flips); since we are speaking only about even formulae, it does not matter in which direction we count 0’s.

It is easy to see that the signed even formula corresponding to any even formula is uniquely defined up to reversing all signs.

**Definition**. The **weight** of an even formula is the absolute value of the sum of all elements of the corresponding signed even formula.

**Lemma 2**. Splitting of an even formula (flipping of two consecutive digits and insertion of 1 between them), preserves its weight modulo 3.

**Proof**. There are three cases.

1) Both digits flip from 0 to 1, i.e. 00 is replaced with 111. In the signed strip all three new 1’s have the same sign, so the weight either increases or decreases by 3, which means no change modulo 3.

2) Both digits flip from 1 to 0, i.e. 11 is replaced with 010. In the corresponding signed sequence it means a change from +1,+1 to 0,-1,0, or from -1,-1 to 0,+1,0; in both cases the sum modulo 3 does not change.

3) One digit flips from 0 to 1, and the second – from 1 to 0, e.g. 01 is replaced with 110. In the corresponding signed sequence it means a change from 0,+1 to -1,-1,0, or from 0,-1 to +1,+1,0; in both cases the sum modulo 3 does not change.

(This lemma, of course, is the central observation.)

**Theorem**. An even sequence of length at least 9 is a strip formula if and only if its weight is divisible by 3, and it does not consist only of 0’s. (We’ll call an even sequence with weight divisible by 3 a **proper sequence**.)

**Proof**. By induction. For length 9 it is easy to see that the only proper sequences not consisting only of zeros are:

```
000000111
000000111
000010011
000011001
000101111
000111101
001010111
001101011
001110101
011011111
```

and that all of them are strip formulae.

Let’s suppose that the theorem statement holds for length n; we’ll prove it for length n+1.

First, by Lemma 1 and Lemma 2 properness is preserved by splitting. Since every strip formula of length n+1 can be produced from a strip formula of length n by splitting, and since by the inductive assumption all strip formulae of length n are proper, we conclude that all strip formulae of length n+1 are also proper.

Conversely, let G be a proper sequence of length n+1 that does not consist only of 0’s. There are two cases:

1) G consists only of 1’s. Let’s replace any subsequence ‘111’ with ‘00' (gluing – the inverse of splitting). Since n≥9, the resulting sequence F does not consist only of 0’s (it includes only two 0’s). Since G can be produced from F by splitting, and G is proper, so is F. By the inductive assumption F is a strip formula; therefore G, produced from F by splitting, is also a strip formula.

2) There is at least one 0 (and at least one 1) in G.. Then G must include a subsequence ‘x10’ (where x is either 0 or 1). Gluing the middle 1, we receive a sequence F which does not consist only of 0’s (because gluing transforms the 0 in ‘x10’ to 1). The rest of the proof is the same as in the previous case.

**Note**. For lengths less than 9 there are several proper sequences not consisting only of 0’s that are not strip formulae, namely:

```
0101
00111
000101
011011
0010011
0101111
00101101
01010101
```

and one strip formula that consists only of 0’s (000000). According to Theorem 1, these are the only exceptions from the identity between strip formulae and proper sequences.

### Scott Sherman

Nice result, Yaacov.  It looks to me like this easily generalizes to other triangle flexagons beyond the hexaflexagon.  The same logic applies whether you start with 000000 for a hexaflexagon, 00000 for a triangle pentaflexagon or 000000000000 for a triangle dodecaflexagon.

I recognize of few of those sequences.  111111111 is the trihexaflexagon, or minimal flexagon for a pinch flex.  001010111 is the minimal tuck.  011011111 is the minimal v-flex.  Or, if you start from 00000, you can generate 001110111, the minimal pentaflexagon for the pyramid shuffle.  Note that a formula for an odd-ordered flexagon (one with an odd number of polygons meeting in the center) may not have a unique weight, but the weights are still equal modulo 3.

Since this result generalizes to other flexagons, I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss some of those other proper sequences as invalid.  111111 is the formula for a 3-sided "flexacup", or triangle tetraflexagon.  You can perform the most basic type of flex on that flexagon, a pocket flex.  01010101 is a 4-sided triangle tetraflexagon.  Though perhaps you would simply consider those as some of the valid sequences you get when starting from 0000, not 000000.

Why does your proof start at length 9?  00111111 is the minimal hexaflexagon for the pocket flex, so you can have a non-trivial hexaflexagon even at length 8.  Though I suppose it also leads to the question of what use is a hexaflexagon such as 0000111, which doesn't allow any sort of flex at all?  I guess those are the sorts of sequences you include in your list of invalid sequences.

### Yaacov Belenky

Scott,

Other triangle flexagons are a fascinating new (for me) direction that I almost did not start to explore yet (but see below); I agree that it would be very interesting to generalize the results to this area and more (e.g.. square flexagons).

As a first generalization, for an arbitrary sequence of 0's and 1's S let's call any sequence that can be produced from S by a sequence of splittings a superstrip of S. Several particular cases of this definition:

```
Superstrips of 000000 = strips from which an arbitrary hexaflexagon can be folded
Superstrips of 111111111 = strips from which a pinchable hexaflexagon can be folded
Superstrips of 011011111 = strips from which a V-flexable hexaflexagon can be folded
Superstrips of 00000 = strips from which an arbitrary pentaflexagon can be folded
```

Why did I start from length 9? Because I want to prove by induction the characteristic property of superstrips of 000000, and this property holds only starting from length 10, so induction base cannot be less than 10. Yes - I should start from length 10, not from 9, because for 9 there is a proper sequence 001001001 that is not a superstrip of 000000 that I overlooked. In any case, I did not mean that shorter proper sequences are invalid in any sense; my list is just the full list of proper sequences that are not formulae of superstrips of 000000. Sequence 00111111 that you mention is both a proper sequence and the formula of a superstrip of 000000; in this sence it is not an exception from my theorem, and that's why I did not list it.

Let's define **gluing** as the operation inverse to splitting. The from my result follows that if we take any strip formula of length at least 11, and perform a single gluing, then the result it also astrip formula, provided that it is not all 0's. Or, in other words, if it is at all possible to fold a flexagon from a strip, you may fold in as you choose, provided that you never reach an all-zeros state, until you reach length 10; only then you must start being more picky in order not to get stuck. I must say, for me it is an unexpected result. In particular, for superstrips of 111111111 and superstrips of 011011111 I see nothing similar.

For pentaflexagons (superstrips of 00000) the only necessary condition that I presently see is an odd number of 0's. I don't see in what sense you can say "the weights are still equal modulo 3", because when the number of 0's is odd, the very notion of weight seems to disappear - with an odd number of 0's, the sign cannot flip at each 0! Note, for example, that both 00000010001 and 00000100001 are strip formulae of pentaflexagons.
Moreover, for general pentaflexagons (superstrips of 00000), similarly to pinchable and V-flexable hexaflexagons, gluing does not necessarily preserve superstripness, and I don't presently see any simple sufficient condition for a sequence to be a superstrip of 00000 / 111111111 / 011011111.

## 11-leaf hexaflexagon
February 12, 2009

### Scott Sherman

I've wondered for awhile if it's possible to flex between all foldings of a flexagon strip, and what flexes would be required if so.  So I figured I'd try a simple hexaflexagon and map out all the possible flexes.  I started with the 3-sided hexaflexagon and added two leaves (for a total of 11) so I could perform a pyramid shuffle on it.

What I ended up with was much more interesting than I expected.  There are two pinch classes of order 3.  You can use a v-flex, tuck flex or pyramid shuffle to transform between the two cycles.  There are two additional states which require a tuck flex to get to.  This gives a total of 10 states, which is more than I anticipated.

I should clarify one detail on the tuck flex.  As I noted before, it isn't its own inverse in general.  Depending on the underlying pat structure, sometimes you can simply flip over the flexagon and do another tuck flex to undo the first one.  But when you can't, you have to perform the tuck flex in reverse in order to get back to the original state.  This is a tricky maneuver, but is doable if you pay close attention to how you performed the tuck flex in the first place.  In this 11-leaf hexaflexagon, the tuck flex is never invertible, so you actually have to include the inverse tuck flex in the list of flexes required in order to freely travel between all 10 states.

In order to reach all 10 states, the tuck flex is required.  There are two "tuck classes" of 5 states each.  To transform between these tuck classes, you can use the pinch flex, v-flex or pyramid shuffle.  Only 8 of the 10 states are accessible if you restrict yourself to just the pinch flex and v-flex.  I have not yet looked into whether these 10 states represent all possible foldings with the same twist.

To make this flexagon, start with a straight strip of 11 equilateral triangles, numbered from 1 to 11.  Fold 3 on 2, 6 on 5, and 9 on 8.  Then tuck 10 under 1, fold 11 under 10 and tape together the outside edges of sides 1 and 11.  (FYI, this final step actually puts a slight bend in the otherwise straight strip.)  I've posted more information at http://loki3.com/flex/diagram/hexa11.html.

### Yaacov Belenky

Scott,

A nice piece of work, and nice and clear explanations and diagrams on
your new page!

In my notation, the formulas of these states are (the first digit
corresponds to the edge 11-1, the second - to 1-2,..., the last - to
10-11):

```
22111111131 - A,B,C
22131111111 - D,E,F
20111113131 - G
00111313131 - H
02131311111 - I
00131313111 - J
```

(The formulas for A,B,C and for D,E,F differ in the starting point - not
shown here - but not in the digits, as always in the formulas of states
of one pinch class.)

The formula of the strip is the same modulo 2, i.e. 00111111111.

It is easy to see that formulas of any two states connected on your
diagram by green, blue or red edge differ only in two positions - in one
by -2, in the second by 2. That's how v-flex, tuck flex and pyramid
shuffle affect the formula, although the preconditions for these flexes
are different.

Several weeks ago I produced a 65M file with all strip formulas and
corresponding pinch class formulas up to order 18 (total of 5233 strips
and about 3.5 million pinch classes). In this list I have 13 pinch
classes for strip 00111111111 - 10 that you have found, and 3 more:

```
00313131111 - K
00113131311 - L
00111131313 - M
```

Note that in K,L,M digits 3 are only in odd positions, while in A-J they
are only in even positions. It means that any position from K,L,M
differs from any position from A-J in at least 3 places (because each of
K,L,M contains three 3's, and each of A-J contains only 1's in these
positions); it sounds like too much for any conceivable flex. K,L,M
might be interconnected, but I did not see how to flex from to another.

Later it came to me that if you split the leaf 1, you receive the
12-leaf straight strip which has 12 pinch classes, 3 states in each
(total of 36 states), whose formulas may be produced by rotation from
the single formula 131313111111. V-flexes connect between these pinch
classes, but the parity of position numbers of 3's remains invariant, so
there are 2 v-classes; tuck flexes and pyramid shuffles also don't help
to connect them. Only in 13 out of these 36 positions it is possible to
glue the "1" leaf back; out of them 10 (A-J) belong to one v-class and 3
(K,L,M) - to the other one.

What I'm wondering now, is what happens with the 15-leaf straight strip
if we glue two leaves together and receive a 14-leaf strip with formula
00111111111111. As far as I can see, it has 29 pinch classes with 3
states each, plus 48 pinch-isolated states - total of 135 states. In the
15-leaf straight strip all states form one v-class, although shortest
paths are longer than I expected (this is the difficult part of the
general theorem about arbitrary states from straight strips). The
question is what happens with this v-class after gluing one leaf -
whether it remains one v-class and many v-isolated states, or does it
split to two non-trivial v-classes.

### Scott Sherman

Yaacov,

After I sent that message, I had also noticed there was at least one state that was isolated given my set of flexes.  I believe I had found state L listed below, but not the other two.

I'm not sure how to fold a strip based on the formula, so I haven't yet tried K and M.  What's interesting is how two states that seem fairly different can generate the same formula.  State A consists of pats with 1, 2 or 3 leaves.  States B and C each have a pat with 4 leaves.  Yet A, B and C all have the same formula.  So obviously the formula isn't a precise folding definition since every state in the same pinch class (which could be quite a few) gives you the same formula.

### Yaacov Belenky

Scott,

I want to use this opportunity to clarify how to fold the strip based on the formula. The first step is to switch from the formula to the Tuckerman map. In order to do this, simply draw straight segments with the lengths defined by formula digits. Between segments change the direction is such a way that the two segments adjacent to segment A are parallel if and only if the length of A is even. (In particular, if a segment has length 0, the two segments adjacent to have the same direction, i.e. one continues the other.) For example, if we start from the formula 22111111131 of the pinch class {A,B,C}, we receive the map shown in the attached file ABC.gif. (The distance between 11 and 1 is 2, between 1 and 2 - 2, between 2 and 3 - 1, and so on.) As you can see, the rightmost triangle is covered three times. This means that there are exactly 3 states in this pinch class that correspond to the vertexes of this triangle; they are marked A,B,C. Let's take, for example, state A. The difference between pinch class formula and flexagon state formula is that in the latter 6 digits are marked; there digits correspond to the connecting edges represented by segments that pass through the vertex corresponding to the flexagon state. To clarify this awfully complicated statement: you can see in ABC.gif that 6 segments pass through the vertex marked with A - (3,4), (6,7), (9,10) in the horizontal direction, and (1,2), (4,5), (7,8) in a slanted direction. Therefore the formula of flexagon state A (as opposed to the formula of the pinch class {A,B,C} is 22111111131, where the marked digits are in bold. Now, how do we use this formula to fold the strip? Let's traverse the entire Tuckerman map, starting from A, making a stop in A every time we pass it, and writing down the distances. For example, let's start from A in the middle between 1 and 2, and move in the direction of 2. The distances are: 1 from A to 2; 1 from 2 to 3; 1 from 3 to A. Stop and write it down: 111. 0 from A to 4; 0 from 4 to A - write 00. 1 from A to 5; 1 from 5 to 6; 1 from 6 to A - once more, 111. 0 from A to 7; 0 from 7 to A - once more, 00. 1 from A to 8; 1 from 8 to 9; 1 from 9 to A - once more, 111. Now, something new: 2 from A to 10; 1 from 10 to 11; 2 from 11 to 1; 1 from 1 to A - write 2121. These are pat formulas: (111)(00)(111) (00)(111) (2121), or, after a rotation (in order to start from the edge connecting leaves 11 and 1), 21)(111)(00) (111)(00) (111)(21. If you replace each x)(y with x+y, you receive the original flexagon state formula 22111111131. Each of pat formulas in the parentheses is represented by a part of the Tuckerman map starting and ending in A. 00 means singleton - there are two singletons, corresponding to leaves 4 and 7. 111 is a single triangle meaning one splitting, i.e. a pat of thickness 2. There are three such pats - leaves 2 and 3 folded together, 5 and 6 folded together, 8 and 9 folded together. The last one is 2121 represented by two triangles. We'll start folding from the one farthest from A (the leftmost one in ABC.gif). It represents leaves 10 and 11 folded together. After that, fold (10 11) with 1. These are exactly your instructions how to fold A from the strip. (Of course, I went in the opposite direction - from your instructions to the formula.) Formulas of B and C just have different marked digits - 22111111131 and 22111111131, or equivalently, different subdivision to pats - 22)(00)(111) (00)(111) (00)(131 and 221)(00)(111) (00)(111) (00)(31.
I hope this clarifies how the flexagon state formula gives a precise folding definition. And sharing the same pinch class formula / Tuckerman map among all flexagon states of a pinch class is for me a fascinating way to represent in a simple form / visualize the invariant property of a pinch class.
See in my article how to find the faces of a flexagon state from its Tuckerman map.

### Scott Sherman

That takes a little while to digest.  So if I understood that, state K is 1 2 (7 4 3 6 5) 8 (10 9) 11, yes?

I assume that your observation that the v-flex, tuck flex and pyramid shuffle all change two positions in the flexagon formula by -2 and 2 is why you felt you wouldn't gain anything by considering more than the v-flex.  But since the preconditions for the flexes are different (as you mentioned earlier), it looks to me like they're not really interchangeable, that each of the flexes could allow you to get to a state the others might not.

### Yaacov Belenky

I'm writing a program to gather some experimental data regarding V-, tuck- and pyramid-classes for arbitrary strips.

### Scott Sherman

I'll think about your questions some more, but here's a quick response to one of them.  The prerequisite for doing a pyramid shuffle seems to limit it more than the v-flex or tuck flex, so it might not open up as many possibilities as the v-flex and tuck flex.  I would expect the tuck flex and v-flex to be fairly interchangeable however.  I was actually surprised that the minimal flexagon for the v-flex had 9 leaves, just like the minimal pinch flex and tuck flex flexagons.

### Yaacov Belenky

Yes, I know how many pinch classes there are in the 6-sided hexaflexagon from a straight strip. There are 1,136 pinch classes, out of them 2 contain 9 states, and every other - 3 states, total of 1,134*3+2*9=3,420 states, which matches Bruce's result. I also know how many pinch classes can be folded from any other strip that contains up to 18 leaves, the maximal number being 2,102 for the 18-leaf strip with formula 011011011111011111. (I am not sure, however, that the total number of states is greater, because many of its pinch classes are trivial.)

I also checked my hypothesis for all states up to 18 leaves. After I uploaded my message as a file, I found that I was mistaken thinging that I found multiple V-classes containing pinchable states folded from the same strip. I erroneously thought that pinch class is non-trivial if and only if its formula contains zeros. Actually, it works only in one direction - a pinch class with a zero in its formula is trivial, but not vice versa. After I discovered this mistake, I added a check into my program, so that it signals every time when there is a strip for which more than one V-class contains pinchable states. Out of thousands of strips, there is only one such strip - the straight 12-leaf strip! So I am pretty sure now that the hypothesis (with this only exception) is true, but still don't know to prove it.

For the v-flex, I know to prove that any non-trivial pinch class is v-flexable, except for the minimal non-trivial pinch class (the trihexaflexagon). I still did not look into the other flexes.

On another topic - do you know whether a linear time algorithm is known that for an arbitrary strip decides whether a flexagon can be folded from it?

### Scott Sherman

Hmmm, I haven't seen anything where the goal was simply to decide if a flexagon can be folded from an arbitrary strip.  The techniques I've tried have generally been about figuring out exactly *how* to fold a flexagon from a strip, which wouldn't be able to answer the existence question in linear time.  Maybe someone else knows...?

### Yaacov Belenky

Yes, K is 1 2 (7 4 3 6 5) 8 (10 9) 11.

Yes, you are right - the same changes by 2 and -2 are the reason why I considered these flexes (not including the slot flex!) equivalent. Your minimal flexagons (that I did not really study yet, but hope to soon) show that the flexes are not interchangeable, and each one adds more states into the class.

On the other hand:
1) In your platonic flexagon (I like this idea; I also thought about it but never verbalized it) they are equivalent;
2) In the flexagons from straight strips v-flex in enough alone; I guess that any of {tuck flex, pyramide shuffle} is anough alone as well, but I never really looked into it;
3) In other kinds of flexagons they are not equivalent,but the states reachable by one of them but not by others are very far from regular states and somehow look less interesting to me (of course, it is already issue of personal taste). I wonder whether the following statement is true: if A and B are pinchable states (i.e. at least one pinch flex from each one), and if A and B are in the same v-class, then they are in the same tuck-class/pyramide class, and vice versa - in other words, the three flexes are equivalent for pinchable positions. Do you have a counterexample for this statement?

### Scott Sherman

After looking at various hexaflexagons, I would guess your conjecture in #3 is probably correct.  The 11-leaf hexaflexagon I posted is the unique minimal flexagon that allows both the pinch flex and pyramid shuffle, and even it allows you to use any of those (2,-2) flexes to travel between the two pinch cycles.

Though it's interesting to note that there are two ways to tuck flex between ABC and DEF, one way to v-flex and one way to pyramid shuffle.  Overall in the state diagram, you can see 10 tuck flexes, 6 pinch flexes, 3 v-flexes and 2 pyramid shuffles.

As to why I find all the states interesting, I think of many flexagons as a puzzle akin to a Rubik's cube where you can "mess it up" with a series of flexes and try to put it back together again.  I tried a slot flex on the straight-strip 6-sided hexaflexagon and found that I could reassemble the sides through a series of tuck flexes and pyramid shuffles.  Is this always possible?  Anything we can learn about what flexes do and how you can transform between various states and classes is interesting for knowing what's possible to "fix".  Knowing there's a sense in which the v-flex, tuck flex and pyramid shuffle are equivalent is interesting.  Knowing that some states are completely inaccessible is interesting.  This is analogous to the states in a Rubik's cube that you can't get to without taking apart the cube.

## Characterization of strips from which a pinchable flexagon can be folded
March 12, 2009

### Yaacov Belenky

In continuation of the thread "Linear time algorithm that decides whether a strip can be folded to a flexagon", I folund a necessary and sufficient condition for a possibility to fold a pinchable flexagon from a strip. For the strip formula definition, see that thread or my article. In order to formulate the condition, I need two definitions:

**Definition 1**. If x[0..n-1] is a cyclic sequence of zeros and ones with an even number of zeros, then its skew is the number calculated by the following pseudocode:

```
skew=0
sign=1
for i=0..n-1
   if x[i]=1
      skew=skew+sign
   else
      sign=-sign
if skew<0
   skew=-skew
```

It is easy to show that cyclic permutations of the sequence preserve the skew (assuming that the number of zeros is even). (That's what in the previous thread I called weight; but this value does not behave as a weight, and I want to use the word weight for something more appropriate,)

**Definition 2**. If x[0..n-1] is an arbitrary cyclic sequence of zeros and ones, its **weight** is calculated as follows:

```
Find all maximal subsequences consisting only of ones;
The weight of each such subsequence is the number of ones in it, divided by 2, rounded up to an integer;
The weight of the sequence is the sum of weights of all maximal subsequences consisting only of ones.
```

For example, weight of 010110111 is 1+1+2=4.

The necessary and sufficient condition is:
1) The number of zeros in the formula is even
2) The skew is divisible by 3
3) The weight is at least 5

## HOMAGE TO A PIED PUZZLER now available
March 31, 2009

### Ann Schwartz

HOMAGE TO A PIED PUZZLER is now available through Amazon. Published by A K Peters, this book has a chapter by Jeff Rutzky and me on the hexa-dodeca- flexagon. There is also one by Jean Pedersen and Peter Hilton, and many other interesting chapters.

The pied puzzler in the title is Martin Gardner.

The URL for the book is http://www.amazon.com/Homage-Pied-Puzzler-Pegg-Jr/dp/1568813155/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1238

The book isn't cheap, but the handy "search inside" feature applies to the title, so you can browse through the book.

To Les Pook especially: I write about flexing on four creases at once, which brings up triangles from three different faces at once and arranges them in a symmetrical pattern; and also how the object can open up into a large parallelogram (which flexes) and some other not-so-obvious maneuvers. They can be made when the flexagon is made from a straight strip--I don't think you can produce the parallelogram without it. I don't think the article you sent me about the hexa-dodeca had these manipulations in it.

## video: decadecaflexagon
March 22, 2009

### Scott Sherman

I've posted a new video showing some interesting flex sequences on the 10-sided isosceles triangle decaflexagon, including...

* ..a flex I call the "flip flex"
* A variation of the pinch flex where you pinch 3 of the 10 hinges on the decaflexagon
* A sequence of flexes that swap out a single leaf on one side, while the other 19 leaves remain in place.  The sequence can be performed on other triangle flexagons, including the hexaflexagon.
* A demonstration that, between the two sides, you can see leaves from all 10 sides at once.  There are probably many other interesting ways to accomplish this.

You can find the video at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COtfw9-UvJY.  The strip to fold this flexagon can be found among my other decaflexagons at http://loki3.com/flex/deca.html.

### Pauline Shreiman

this group is definately not for beginners. it is for experienced

### Scott Sherman

Certainly some of the posts can get pretty advanced, but there has actually been quite a mix.  People are most likely to post new discoveries of course, which almost by definition is more advanced.  And where else could you have a conversation on flexagon theory?

But there are some good examples of posts that don't require as much background.  For example, Robin Moseley has posted a series of interesting patterns he has created on hexaflexagons.  He also has several dodecaflexagons plus a video showing a series of flexes if you want to try something more challenging.  You can find these at http://www.flexagon.net/.  Ann Schwartz has a series of articles on a variety of topics, including several on flexagons at http://www.eighthsquare.com/.

I started from the assumption that most people who joined this group already learned about hexaflexagons from one of the many websites that describe them or from some form of Martin Gardner's articles.  So I posted about an interesting assortment of other types of flexagons made from triangles and put them at http://loki3.com/flex/triangles.html.  Many of these aren't much more difficult than the hexaflexagon, though you may need other flexes for some of them.  I tried describing them in words and pictures at http://loki3.com/flex/flex/index.html.  But it really helps to see these flexes in action, so recently I've posted a series of videos.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsaEhpDgWd8 demonstrates some of the flexes I take for granted the decadecaflexagon video, for example.  Some of my others focus on showing some of the other basic flexes.  But with this last video, I intentionally showed a more complex flexagon and more complex sequences to give people an idea of some of the more advanced possibilities.

But I only know when my explanations are unclear or if I'm leaving out important steps when I get feedback.  On a previous video, Pauline had asked if there was a video showing how to make the flexagon being demonstrated, so I've started including the folding steps in my videos.  With this last one, it takes long enough to fold it that I didn't include the whole process.  I tried to show enough that you get a feel for how to proceed.

I'm sure other people have some interesting examples as well.  Or questions and comments...

### Yaacov Belenky

Scott,

A great video! That's the first time I folded a flexagon from non-equilateral triangles and did a 3-3-4 pinch flex. Looks like Tuckerman map still makes sense while Tuckerman traverse does not (i.e. the map cannot be traversed - there is no analogue of the regular pinch flex). The compact strip formula is 0111101111, and the compact flexagon state formula (as it is folded in the video) is 2133321333. Here red means a short connecting edge, and bold means, as usual, a pat connecting edge - which, of course, cannot be short (or can it?). I need to draw it to explain more; hope to do it in the next message. The 3-3-4 pinch flex seems to increase 3 intervals on the Tuckerman map by 2, and decrease other 3 intervals by 2.

Pauline,

The video is indeed a little fast, but fortunately it is possible to stop and rewind it. It is my first experience with decaflexagons, and it took some time, but I managed to reproduce the folds from the video. Where did you experience problems - with folding or with flexing?
This is AFAIK the only active flexagon forum, and it is meant for beginners as well as for more experienced people.

Everybody,

My "Theory of Hexaflexagons" has been posted about a month and a half ago. Since then I proved several more general theorems; the last one says that, using pinch flexes and v-flexes, it is possible to move from any pinchable state to any other pinchable state folded from the same strip with the same handedness, with the only exception for the 12-leaf straight strip. The proof, however, is significantly trickier than for my first theorem. I would like to receive some feedback before I start to write down proofs of the most general and other theorems. Those who started to read the article - how far did you get? Was anything unclear? Did anybody verify my proof?

### Les Pook

Pauline

I agree that some postings are for the experienced, but we do try to help newcomers. Have you any specific questions that you would like answered?

Martin Gardner's recent book Hexaflexagons, probability paradoxes, and the Tower of Hanoi. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008, is a good introduction to flexagons. My own book Flexagons inside out. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003, is written with beginners in mind. I have another book, coming out later this year, which includes some more recent developments, up to about the end of last year.

As Scott mentions about my website, www.flexagon. net, I have posted downloadable templates for several of the traditional flexagons that started this great flexagon movement.  These are displayed on my home page and can get anyone started without any background.  I have also tried to detail the multi-sided variations that grow from the traditional tri-hexaflexagon.  I have enjoyed these variations for many years and still have fun desiging and folding them as much today as I did when in college many years ago.  These are the flexagons invented by the Princeton Flexagon Committee which was founded in 1939 and which actually has a myspace group:

I get email all the time from teachers and others that use my basic flexagon patterns in classes and activities from high school to college activities.  I recently even had a graphic arts college professor contact me with interest in some of my templates for her classes and an upcoming textbook.  Flexagons have a broad range of aspects that expand beyond just the mathematical properties which certainly have been one of the reasons for the continued interest in them. For example, I know that many people, including myself, have used flexagons as business cards.    If there are other beginners lurking out there, don't be intimidated by the more advanced posts, I believe everyone here welcomes discussion at all levels.  There is no other group like this on the Interent, so we need to support all levels of discussion!

## Serious fun with flexagons
April 18, 2009

### Les Pook

My book 'Serious fun with flexagons. A companion and guide.' is due to be published by Springer in July 2009. The blurb reads:

'A flexagon is a motion structure that has the appearance of a ring of hinged polygons. It can be flexed to display different pairs of faces, usually in cyclic order. Flexagons can be appreciated as toys or puzzles, as a recreational mathematics topic, and as the subject of serious mathematical study. Workable paper models of flexagons are easy to make and entertaining to manipulate. The mathematics of flexagons is complex, and how a flexagon works is not immediately obvious on examination of a paper model. Recent geometric analysis, included in the book, has improved theoretical understanding of flexagons, especially relationships between different types.

This profusely illustrated book is arranged in a logical order appropriate for a textbook on the geometry of flexagons. It is written so that it can be enjoyed at both the recreational mathematics level, and at the serious mathematics level. The only prerequisite is some knowledge of elementary geometry, including properties of polygons. A feature of the book is a compendium of over 700 nets for making paper models of some of the more interesting flexagons, chosen to complement the text. These are accurately drawn and reproduced at half full size. Many of the nets have not previously been published. Instructions for assembling and manipulating the flexagons are included.'

The book is written in much the same spirit as the Conrad and Hartline report, but I have tried to make the mathematics more accessible. I have included references to some Flexagon Lovers Group postings up to the end of last year, and also to some flexagon videos. Photographs of flexagons are in black and white, but I hope to upload colour versions of at least some of them to my website www.pook.org.uk.

### Ann Schwartz

Congratulations, Les.

Please send the link to Amazon or the publisher as soon as there is one, so I can post it.

I eagerly look forward to reading your new book...and making the flexagons described in it.

### Les Pook


I have checked, and the book is available for pre-order from Amazon at a discount. The US link is http://www.amazon.com/Serious-Fun-Flexagons-Compendium-Applications/dp/9048125022/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1240131636&sr=1-1 and the UK link is http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_ss_w_h_?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=serious+fun+pook&x=15&y=16 It is probably easier to use the Amazon search facility! 'Pook serious' works.

The Springer UK link, from which the flyer can be downloaded, is http://www.springer.com/math/geometry/book/978-90-481-2502-9 Chapter summaries will be made available online. I'm not sure when.

Ah, yes! that mathematics ...

Who was the ancient Greek philosopher who said that knowing is
not enough; you have to know that you know?

The history of flexagons may be as interesting as the flexagons
themselves, and is vastly harder to reconstruct. But one wonders
whether the same may not be true of any discipline? Anyway, there
seems to be some agreement that what we now regard as flexagons
began with Arthur Stone in Princeton in the late 1930's. He and
his friends evidently discussed and experimented with them at
length. There has been some mention of a written record, but as
far as I know noone has ever seen it. Apparently the group
dissipated with the onset of World War II.

Flexagons were publicized through the Westinghouse National
Science Talent Search, and some written material was created
by participants, but apparently none of it remains. I saw one
document, learned about how to anticipate a flexagon via a
diagram - the trees and triangles and so on, but have lost my
copy.

The article of Oakley and Wisner must have arisen through some
sort of contact with the Princeton group, and it would seem that
having returned to England, Stone must have spread some ideas
about that made their way to publications like Mathematical
Gazette.

Anyway, what knlowledge there was seems to have been extremely
fragmented, and everybody seems to have tried to organize what
knowledge or experience they had in their own way. Myself, it
was natural to try to map a flexagon, but unfortunately I should
have drawn it differently, not getting the dual that I should
have. That really held up my further understanding of flexagons.
I have often wondered if Tukey or Feynman or whoever worked from
the dual, because doing so makes the construction of an arbitrary
flexagon quite obvious.

Oakley and Wisner tried to give a recursive definition of a
flexagon, in terms of pats and thumbholes. Myself, I had just
come from working with Riemann surfaces in complex variable
theory, branch points and covering spaces, which was the origin
of the splitting theory of flexagon construction. Unfortunately
that insight did not extend to triple of multiple splitting for
polygons beyond triangles. Part of what I mean by "knowing what
you know."

Anyway, those ideas were part of what Hartline and Conrad had
to work with. I recall their announcing the two basic principles
of flexagon theory: 1) "any polygon can be flexagonned. " 2) "the
sum of the angles has to be 360 degrees." It was years before I
really understood what they were talking about. Meanwhile
Michael Schlessinger had a viewpoint similar to what was being
published in England along the lines of polygon dissections to
enumerate flexagons. If that was ever written up, it didn't
make it into a RIAS report and if there ever was a copy I've
lost it.

Anyway, this gives some idea of why that RIAS report was
organized the way it was. Everybody was still trying to decide
what a flexagon was, and how to describe it. Tony was quite an
accomplished artist, and there was another student, both trying
to get some informative drawings of flexagons. I wonder why we
never hit on flexacubes? Suffice it to say that it is not such
a trivial exercise to get a good depiction of the workings of
flexagons. In those days there were no videocameras as there
are now, but even so an intelligible presentation has to be
very carefully planned.

Now it is many (45?) years later; thanks to the Internet that
RIAS report has gotten some circulation. In the meantime the
idea of Mandelbrot sets and fractals has become widely known.
True, flexagons have a recursive definition thanks to Oakley
and Wisner; but perhaps such ideas are more familiar and
informative than they were way back then? Then, there was the
decisive contribution by John Conway, that flexagons can be a
permutation stack (look at the stack, not the frieze), not just
a fractal stack (relplace any face by its cyclic complement,
then turn it over = the sum of the angles has to be 360 degrees).

For those who would like an update of the RIAS report, I would
reccommend my "A Quick Flexagon Survey," although I doubt that
it has had much circulation outside of the archives of this
group (or the CIEA). And one can really bask in "if only you
knew what you know!"

### Bruce McLean

How do I get to

"A Quick Flexagon Survey,"

### Harold McIntosh

You could ask Google for it, but that seems to turn up only an
HTML version. It is a little trickier to get the PDF version of
about 37 pages, but I hope the following link will work. I won't
know until I've posted this message, so I hope I'm not repeating
my previous posting goof.

http://delta.cs.cinvestav.mx/~mcintosh/comun/gonafle/gonaflex.pdf

Actually the document should be in the Flexagon Lovers Archives,
but I have never mastered or even slightly learned how to use
Yahoo!, this group or any other.

If you can get into the CINVESTAV files, there are several
flexagon articles and I think, a video or two (in spanish).

Let's hope this works; otherwise I'll be back.

## Flexagon archive
April 23, 2009

### Les Pook

There is a Wikipedia entry for 'Flexagon', an archive of nearly 600 postings at the Flexagon Lovers Group, and Googling 'flexagon*' results in 13,700 hits. From recent Flexagon Lovers Group postings it is clear that some sort of index to significant postings in the flexagon archive would be helpful. By 'significant' I mean postings that contribute to the debate, either directly, or by providing links. Construction of an index to significant postings involves both a lot of work and making value judgments. My suggestion is that Members could perhaps compile their own lists of significant postings. My own list is below. The subject lines are not always appropriate since some of the postings are replies. A posting can easily be found once its number is known. It is possible to list postings by a particular author by using the Advance Search facility.
