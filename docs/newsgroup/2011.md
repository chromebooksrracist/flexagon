## Re: Season's Greetings

### Bob Harris

Les, I'm having some trouble understanding how to accomplish the over-centre flex indicated at the bottom of page 2 and top of page 3. Every time I attempt it I end up with the original net. By any chance is there a video of this (or similar) flex?

### Les Pook

I haven't got any videos. When you get the flexagon looking like Figure 4(b) fasten the pats together with paper clips. This should let you complete the flex without the flexagon falling apart. The stability of the flexagon depends on the type of paper or card used.

Flexing difficulties are one of the treasons that snap flexagons weren't included in 'Serious Fun with Flexagons'.

### Les Pook

A substantially cheaper paperback edition of 'Serious fun with flexagons. A compendium and guide.' is now available from Springer to people who have access, through their libraries, to Springer ebooks. The text is identical to the original hardback edition. The following link lets you read the book online.

## square tetraflexagons
August 23, 2011

### Scott Sherman

Awhile back I did a series on flexagons made from a variety of triangles.  I figured next I would do some made out of various quadrilaterals.  Naturally, the first place to start is with the square tetraflexagon.  This was the second type of flexagon discovered, after the triangle hexaflexagon.

I put up a video at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaB8wnbyQOM showing the pinch flex (aka book flex), different box flexes (I was surprised I couldn't find any videos showing the box flex) and variations on the tuck flex (a very tricky flex on a square flexagon).

You can find a collection of templates at http://loki3.com/flex/square.html.  I approached organizing the templates a bit differently.  Rather than listing them based on the number of sides, they're organized based on the sequence of flexes necessary for creating them, i.e. their flex generating sequence (see post 614, http://tech.dir.groups.yahoo.com/group/Flexagon_Lovers/message/614).  This is a succinct way to differentiate between flexagons with the same number of sides.  For example, I have 6 different 4 sided flexagons from the generating sequences PP, P>P, Pl>Pr, P^>P, Bt, and Bb.

### Kathy Knapp

Looks like fun.  I'll have the local origami group give it a go in Oct.  In September we will be folding new things that I learned at Centerfold Origami Convention in Columbus, Ohio.  I do the tetra tetra flexagon, and a tri hexaflexagon with my summer students.  I'm not sure they are ready for this, but if I find it easy, just maybe, then....  What kind of permission is needed to make copies and teach?

Thanks

### Ann Schwartz

As usual, some wonderful videos from Scott/Loki.

### Scott Sherman

Feel free to use any of the templates on my site for your students.

### Kathy Knapp

Thank you.  And the school will be willing then to make the color copies for me.

## Martin Gardner Special Issue
August 24, 2011

### Les Pook

The Martin Gardner Special Issue of  'The College Mathematics Journal' will be published in January 2012. It will contain two articles on flexagons, one of them by myself.

### Ann Schwartz

What is the subject and title of your article? Do you know who wrote the other article and what it is about?

### Bruce McLean

Actually there are 3 articles. The first one is the original by Martin Gardner. Ours is entitled

    The V-flex, Triangle Orientation, and Catalan Numbers in Hexaflexagons
    by Ionut E. Iacob, T. Bruce McLean and Hua Wang
    of Georgia Southern University

Hua was able to change our algorithmic theorems into very nice closed combination formulas and Ionut provides a finite state diagram on how flexagons are constructed.

### Les Pook

The title of my article is 'From hexaflexagons to edge flexagons to point flexagons'. It's written as a short introduction to flexagons for mathematicians. I don't know the title of the other article, or its author(s). The Editor was coy about this information. However, I do know that he was keen to ensure that the articles complemented each other.

### Les Pook

It is permissible to post my forthcoming article in the Martin Gardner Special Issue online, provided that copyright is acknowledged. I will post it on the Flexagon Lovers group, and also on my website www.pook.org.uk, which has quite a lot of traffic to the Flexagons page.

None of the links in Ann's last email work, except for 'Visit Your Group'. Has anyone else had this problem?

## Martin Gardner
August 24, 2011

### Kathy Knapp

How timely!

Today I was looking at an article that was saved for me.  It mentions Martin Gardner's article in Scientific American, in 1975, that was about Tessellations and tesseracts. I wasn't given all of the article, so I am not sure how Marjorie Rice's fascination with the article in SA brought her ' minor fame in the world of math'.

The article was in ChiMe, the newsletter of Chicago Area Mensa, April, 2008, vol.28, Number 4.  On the cover is a level 3 Menger Sponge that has been cut in half diagonally to reveal a constellation of six-pointed stars.  It is amazing!  The center is a large 6 pointed star, surrounded with 6 smaller stars, and then all the other opeings are stars.  What can be seen through and on the sides, looks like a 'regular' Menger Sponge.  I would have never thought of cutting in diagonally in half to get this star feature.  It does not appear to be from business card, which would make the cutting possible.  What was it made from?

### Scott Sherman

Cool.  I hadn't seen that before.  Looks like that was originally done by Sebastien Perez Duarte.  Here's a picture he made of it - http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbprzd/1432723128/ - which looks like it's computer generated.  George Hart created one from a 3D printer, which you can see at http://www.georgehart.com/rp/half-menger-sponge.html.  People have even tried folding those out of paper...

### Kathy Knapp

Yes, that is the way it looks, more like a 'real' one than the computer drawn.  There may be more information in the newsletter, but all that I have is the cover and the beginning of the article about Martin Gardner.  I'll try to obtain more of the issue.

## kite hexaflexagon
August 30, 2011

### Scott Sherman

Next in the series is the kite hexaflexagon.  You can watch the video at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z-XUxN5TlQ and find the template and more information at http://loki3.com/flex/kite.html.

The shape I've chosen is a kite with a 60 degree angle, 120 degree angle and two right angles.  Thus you can make a flexagon that lies flat some of the time if you have 6 kites to make a hexaflexagon or 4 kites to make a tetraflexagon.  The video shows the kite hexaflexagon using various flexes - the pinch flex, flip flex, pyramid shuffle, silver tetra and tuck flex.  The particular hexaflexagon I chose is actually a bronze hexaflexagon in disguise, so you get an interesting mix of box flexes and flexes you see on triangle flexagons.  I recommend making it so that you can easily disconnect it and refold it if you get too lost with all the flexes, since this one is trickier than the square tetraflexagon.

### Kathy Knapp

On the video, at time stamp 1:38-1:40, what did you do to connect the edges of the #1s?  Aren't usually two white sides glued together?  You did say it could easily be disassembled, but I'm just not sure how it stays together.  Perhaps I should just make one.

### Leslie Cefali

Tape....

### Scott Sherman

What I didn't show was that I had already put tape on one leaf.  Once I was done folding, I simply used that tape to connect the two ends together.  If you look carefully at around 1:02-1:04, you can see the tape on the left side of the template.

### Kathy Knapp

Thanks!  It did seem you were pressing, but like aligning the edges was all that I could see.

## interleaf folding of edge flexagons
September 12, 2011

### Scott Sherman

This post is for those interested in theory or in folding challenges...

Consider the basic hexahexaflexagon (the 6 sided hexaflexagon from a straight strip of paper) and use the standard numbering (one side is numbered 1-2-3-1-2-3 with the other side numbered 4-4-5-5-6-6).  If you look at the pairs of sides you can flex to, you'll see 1/2, 2/3, 3/1, 1/4, 1/5, 2/4, 2/6, 3/5, and 3/6.

The hexahexaflexagon is made from three "sectors", i.e. three copies of the underlying pattern.  If you make a flexagon out of just a single sector, you get a 6 sided point flexagon (see post 294, http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/Flexagon_Lovers/message/294, and following posts).  Because of the way you make these out of paper, you typically have the same number on the top and bottom, but if you stop half way through a flex, you have two of one number on one side and two of another number on the other side, which is a third of a hexaflexagon.  If you look at the state diagram for this point flexagon, you'll see that you can find all the pairs of numbers you see on the hexahexaflexagon plus 4/5, 5/6 and 6/4.  Why does the single sector flexagon have states that the three sector flexagon doesn't?

It turns out that it doesn't; they have the same states.  You can't flex to those extra states, but you can fold the template into those states.  Once you fold into one of those extra states, you can flex between them.  It's not simple to fold; it requires what I call interleaf folding.  I had realized interleaf folding was sometimes required for a point flexagon (see post 314, http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/Flexagon_Lovers/message/314), but I hadn't realized there were times when you could do the same with an edge flexagon such as the hexaflexagon.

After some further experimenting, I think I know how to predict when an interleaf folding is required on an edge flexagon: if the point flexagon has nested hinges, the nested face(s) will require interleaf folding on the corresponding edge flexagon.  For example, if you look at the hinges accessible from side 4 on the point flexagon mentioned above, you'll see that side 5 is nested inside the hinges for side 1 and side 6 is nested inside the hinges for side 2.  This means you can access states 1/4 and 2/4 on the edge flexagon but states 4/5 and 4/6 require interleaf folding.

Key observations of interleaf folding for an edge flexagon:

* It's often possible to interleaf fold an edge flexagon into states you can't flex to
* You can predict these extra states by looking for nested hinges in the corresponding one sector flexagon, aka point flexagon
* These extra states require interleaf folding across multiple sectors
* It's possible to fold a flexagon such that the template for each sector connects to itself rather than the other sectors
* It's possible to have a face where no adjacent pair of top-most leaves come from the same sector
* A pat no longer consists simply of consecutive leaves from the underlying strip

Interleaf foldings are challenging puzzles.  I've included the 6 sided flexagon described here plus some others at http://loki3.com/flex/interleave/edge.html for anyone who's up for a folding challenge.

### Les Pook

I've only just seen your Message #752. The email version didn't reach me. I first came across this when trying to understand one of the flexagons described by David Mitchell in his book 'The Magic of Flexagons'. His square flexagon can be interleaf flexed into an interleaved state, but this is difficult. I mention interleaf flexing very briefly on p. 248 of  'Serious Fun with Flexagons, but haven't pursued it, so had a look at your website with interest.

### Scott Sherman

Les, is that the same flex you describe on pages 78-81 of Flexagons Inside Out?  If so, and I understand it correctly, that flex may require interleaving during the flex, but it doesn't require an interleaf folding.  In other words, you can fold the net to the before or after state using the standard method of folding, where adjacent leaves are folded together at every step.  The interleaf folding I describe can't be achieved by folding together adjacent leaves.

The interleaf folding  seems to have something in common with "slipagons" as well, but is actually something different.

### Les Pook

Yes. it is basically the same flex as described on pp. 78-81. Skeletal flexagons and point flexagons can always be flexed, including interleaf flexagons, without leaf bending. The difference is that leaf bending, sometimes severe, may be needed to interleaf flex an edge flexagon. I've checked my notes on David Mitchell's double cross flexagon (p. 7 in his book 'The Magic of Flexagons') and his interleaf flex appears to have achieved a transformation between flexagons. I suspect, but haven't checked, that interleaving would be needed to assemble the flexagon into the transformed form. This is one of the topics that didn't make it into 'Serious Fun with Flexagons'. It deserves further investigation. A practical difficulty is deciding how much leaf bending is permissible.

### Scott Sherman

No, an interleaf folding is not required.  The post-interleaf-flex state you describe is 2(B).  You could fold to this state by folding 1C on 6C, 1A on 4A twice, then the final 1C against the 6C., all accomplished by simply folding adjacent faces together.  This is related to the question I've asked before about whether it's possible to flex to all possible states of a flexagon.  And, if so, what flexes are required?  For David Mitchell's double cross flexagon, apparently the interleaf flex is required.

The one piece of the general answer we've discussed before is that you can't flex between states that are topologically different, e.g. because they have different torsion (i.e. number of twists) - see post 336, etc. for some discussion.  I believe that a flexagon that requires an interleaf folding is topologically distinct from one that doesn't.  Therefore, it's impossible to flex from a non-interleaved flexagon to an interleaved flexagon, in the same way you can't flex between flexagons with different torsion without disconnecting, folding a different way, then reconnecting.

## how do you define a valid flex?
September 22, 2011

### Scott Sherman

Another question Les raised is one we've discussed before:  what do you consider a valid flex?  You could apply your feeling of aesthetics, but that's a bit vague.  You could declare that you only allow flexes that don't require any bending, but even that is murkier than you might expect.  As I pointed out in post 533, a flex that requires bending on one flexagon may not require any bending on another, making the restriction feel a bit artificial.

My working definition:  A flex is a series of pat splitting, folding and sliding that transforms a flexagon from one valid state to another.

This rules out cutting and refolding.  It rules out something I showed in my rhombus flexagon video (starting about 1:08 in the video at http://loki3.com/flex/rhombus.html) because it doesn't result in a valid flexagon because there are "flaps".  But it does allow the interleaf flex, tuck flex, pyramid shuffle and many of the other flexes we've discussed.  I include "sliding" in my definition because it allows the v-flex, slot flex, slot tuck and others, but you could do lots of interesting exploration even if you just restricted yourself to splitting and folding of pats.  (See http://loki3.com/flex/flex/index.html for a list of some of the possible flexes.)

My personal feeling is that the pinch flex isn't an essential part of the definition of a flexagon.  It's an elegant flex that's fun to explore and is backed by an elegant theory, but there's a lot more to flexagons than that.

### Kathy Knapp

I think most of this is a bit beyond me, but when I went back to the 1:08 viewing, that was a totally new to me way of getting to the flex.  It looks like a 'flip' move.  So why isn't it valid?  It got to a another side?

### Scott Sherman

In the video, I start from a position where the back is all 1's and the front is all 2's.  After that first move (~1:12), the front side has four 2's, one 4 and one 5.  The back side has three 1's, one 2, one 3 and one 4.  Examine the pat that has a 2 on both the front and back (where a "pat" is one of the six stacks of leaves).  Notice that you can open it up along a single hinged edge and flip it back and forth.  That "flap" is what I feel makes it so your flexagon is no longer in a valid state.  It looks like the "flip flex" (http://loki3.com/flex/flex/flip.html), but isn't.

Basically I'm defining a "valid flex" in terms of what it accomplishes more than how you did the flex.  Of course, you may decide to restrict yourself further based on aesthetics or pragmatics.  For example, when I was mapping out all the states of the 5 sided hexaflexagon, I didn't use what I call the "forced tuck" (see post 642) because it's too hard to do without ripping your flexagon.

### Ann Schwartz

I like Scott's definition of a valid flex.

I came upon the same problem with the hexa-dodeca-flexagon, when made from a straight strip.

From some hexagonal faces you can flex along four equidistant axes. Rather, soon after you try to flex, the object opens into a parallelogram made of twelve right triangles. You can then "flex" the parallelogram along its long diagonal. However, you have to push the 120-degree corners into the center, forcing them and bending the flexagon slightly. But this action yields a new face with lovely symmetry. The parallelogram can then be flexed into a cup, which, interestingly enough, reveals the triangles (gray in my model) that normally stay hidden. So I think this is a valid flex.

By the way, this parallelogram also displays "toggle triangles": triangles unattached at one corner that can be swiveled over. In this case, however, the flexagon can't be flexed when they are toggled over.

I described this in the chapter on hexa-dodeca-flexagons in "Homage to a Pied Puzzler". Not described in the chapter is what happens when you push through the cup, forcing the hidden triangles to the outside of it. From that position the object can be arranged back into a parallelogram, and then back to a hexagon. But now the "hidden" triangles mix with the rest, sometimes forming symmetrical patterns, sometimes not. I think raising the hidden triangles changes the way the strip was originally folded, changing the essential nature of the flexagon. But maybe it should just be considered a wormhole. Of course, with little bending and forcing, you can "go back the way you came," and hide the gray triangles again.

I hope someday to do a video someday. These things are easier to show than to explain.

Wishing everyone in this user group a wonderful holiday season
and a happy 2012 filled with health, joy, success...and, of course, flexagons.
