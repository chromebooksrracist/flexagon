## new book about flexagons
January 4, 2016

### Nick Robinson

I'm an origami author

http://www.nickrobinson.info/origami/index.php

and am working on a book of flexagons. I know the regular designs, but can you point me at anything more unusual? perhaps a triangular or circular profile?

I'm including the "flipper"

even though it's not a proper flexagon. Is there a technical/accepted name for this type of design? I've created a hexagonal version, is this original?

Are "kaleidocycles" classed as flexagons?

Thanks in advance ;)

Hi Nick,

Welcome to the user group and forgive my lateness in answering your post.

Your Web site looks fantastic, bravo for your original designs.

The flexagons you attached with the cartoony-looking characters are flexagons that I have seen before. Ed Hutchins, of artistbooks.com, among others, has made them. They are indeed considered flexagons.

Your three-dimensional piece looks new to me, but those are not my area of expertise, fascinating as they are. (To the group: can anyone help with this?)

I have discovered a number of flexagons made of triangles, but am saving them for my own possible commercial use. But there is a wonderful square flexagon composed of right triangles that is often ignored, and a hexagon-shaped flexagon that I have posted on the Internet.

I will talk about those and give links in a separate post asap.

Apologies for not responding earlier. I think another book on flexagons
is timely, it is a number of years since my book 'Serious fun with
flexagons' was published.

I would suggest including pyramid flexagons, which are not described in
my book. See

### Nick Robinson

thanks. Have sent a provisional list to the publishers, but if/when they reject any I'll look into this!

## New YouTube Videos
January 20, 2016

### Ann Schwartz

There are some new videos on YouTube in which I demonstrate folding and flexing flexagons. They come complete with downloads of the flexagons and written directions for folding them up. There are seven of them, including two for the 8-gon, a square flexagon made of 8 isosceles right triangles per face.

This flexagon is fully described in Jean Pedersen and Peter Hilton's books, "Build Your Own Polyhedra" and "A Mathematical Tapestry." Pages from "Build Your Own Polyhedra" on the 8-gon (Pedersen and Hilton's term) can be found at http://www.eighthsquare.com/8-gon.html. David Mitchell also has the the 8-gon  in his "The Magic of Flexagons" and his sliver flexagon books. I have been working with the 8-gons made from a straight strip.

This flexagon has a peculiarity: there is always one face that will not flex out flat per side. For instance, in the video about the 8-gon with four faces, the tetra-8-on, the red face does not appear in a planar state until the flexagon is flipped over. Then, when it is flipped over, the green face does not flex out flat. Can anyone tell me why this is?

If you make the flexagon with a longer strip and more faces, the phenomenon persists. I have found this so with the 8-gon with 8 faces, the octa-8-gon, and the one with 12 faces. In each of them, there is always one face on each side that does not flex flat until you flip it over. I thought perhaps that the number of faces that "hide" would increase with the length of the strip, but this doesn't seem to be so!

The 8-gon also introduces a new flex, which Pedersen and Hilton have dubbed "reverse-pass-through" that is important in other complex flexagons. Of course David Mitchell discovered this maneuver on his own.

Among the videos is one showing Robin Moseley's wonderful magic square tetraflexagon (thank you, Robin for your permission to use it). Also included is one of the hexadodecaflexagon that shows some of its secrets, like the two flexagons within it.

I coined some terms for the faces of the hexahexaflexagon that are referred to in the videos. I call the faces that appear more often the “dominant faces” and those that appear less often the “surprise faces.” The dominants have six open creases and the surprises only three. If these faces have been already distinguished with names, please let me know!

6) Octa-8-gon https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USUiHK12aUg

The videos were all made last spring at the Recreational Math, Puzzles, and Games Conference a the Davidson Institute, the educational arm of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. A big thank you to Judith Golan who produced the videos and put up with my constant edits, and to Dr. Yossi Elran, who invited me to be the conference’s guest speaker and focused the conference on flexagons

The whole event was an amazing experience but one of the biggest thrills was the third day when the conference was open to the public. Two flexagon workshops were scheduled, but a third had to be added because of the demand. The children were delighted with hexaflexagons and 8-gons and some of them hounded me to help them between workshops. I don’t think there’s any doubt that the next generation will be flexing.

Fyi: the paper used in the models is Chromo-Mat, 170 gr., which worked very well. Also, I tried to put my two Powerpoint presentations from the conference in the files section but they were too big even as ZIP files. If anyone has any suggestions about how to get around that, I’d appreciate it.

## Sad news
September 8, 2016

### Ann Schwartz

I have some sad news to relate:

Jean Pedersen, a lontime professor of mathematics at Santa Clara University in California, and the coauthor of “A Mathematical Tapestry” as well as many other books and numerous papers on mathematics, died on Janurary 1, 2016. She had a special interest in polyhedral geometry. An excerpt from “Build Your Own Polyhedra,” which she coauthored with Peter Hilton can still be seen at http://eighthsquare.com/8-gon/html. The piece describes how to make a square flexagon made of isosceles right triangles.

Harold V. McIntosh, a frequent contributor to this forum and one of the world’s leading experts on flexagons, died on November 30, 2015. From 1975 on, he was a professor at Universidad Autónoma de Puebla in Mexico. Here are two obituaries that describe his many accomplishments.

Dear Ann

That's a shame, thanks for letting me know.
