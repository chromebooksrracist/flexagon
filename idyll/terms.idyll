  [dt]flex[/dt]
  [dd]
  A series of modifications to a flexagon that takes it from one valid state to another,

  [dd]
  Doing a flex in reverse.

  *Flex notation* adds `'` to a flex symbol to indicate its inverse, e.g. `P'` for the inverse of the pinch flex `P`.
  [/dd]

  [dt]current hinge[/dt]
  [dd]
  The hinge that a flex is performed relative to.
  Especially useful in a sequence of flexes so you know where to apply the next flex.
  [br/][br/]
  *Flex notation* uses `>`, `<`, and `^` to indicate how to change the *current hinge*.
  Sometimes *current vertex* or *current corner*.
  [/dd]

  [dt]flex definition[/dt]
  [dd]
  A description of the effects of a flex, listing the before and after states in *pat notation*

* in: `[ [1,2], 3, ... i, ... [[n-4,n-3],[n-2,n-1]], n ]`
* out: `[ n-3, [[-1,3],[n,-2]] ... i, ... n-2, [-(n-4),-(n-1)] ]`
  [/dd]

  [dt]prime flex[/dt]
  [dd]
  A flex that can't be decomposed into other flexes.
  Or, more precisely, we can say a flex is *prime relative to* a given set of flexes
  if the flex isn't exactly equal to any possible combination of those other flexes.
  [/dd]
[/dl]

[a name:'naming'/]
# Naming of flexagon traits

The following lists traits of flexagons I feel should have names, followed by my proposal.

[dl]
  [dt]The polygon used for *leaves*[/dt]
  [dd]
  Preface *flexagon* with the polygon, e.g. "triangle flexagon" or "hexagon flexagon".
  [br/][br/]
  For example, the following is called a *pentagon flexagon* because the leaves are pentagons.
  [br/]
  [img src:'static/terms/pentagon-flexagon.jpg' height:150/]
  [/dd]

  [dt]The number of *leaves* in the *main position*[/dt]
  [dd]
  Use a Greek prefix, e.g. "hexaflexagon" for any flexagon with 6 leaves in the main position
  and "pentaflexagon" for any flexagon with 5 leaves in the main position.
  [br/][br/]
  For example, the first image below shows a "pentagon hexaflexagon"
  and the second image shows a "triangle pentaflexagon".
  [br/]
  [img src:'static/terms/pentagon-hexaflexagon.jpg' height:150/]
  [img src:'static/terms/pentaflexagon.jpg' height:150/]
  [/dd]

  [dt]The angles in the leaf polygons[/dt]
  [dd]
  For triangle flexagons, use terms that capture properties like symmetry and right angles
  that impact the flexes that can be performed.
  These include *regular* (60-60-60), *silver* (45-45-90), *bronze* (30-60-90), *isosceles*, and *right*.
  [br/][br/]
  Special quadrilaterals include *square*, *kite*, *rhombus*, and *trapezoid*.
  [br/][br/]
  In the general case, you can list the angles in the leaf polygon.
  Since orientation matters, I list the angles in a well-defined order,
  starting with the angle in the center of the flexagon and going clockwise.
  [br/][br/]
  For example, the following is a *right decaflexagon*.
  [br/]
  [img src:'static/terms/right-decaflexagon.jpg' height:150/]
  [/dd]

  [dt]The number of faces when every face can be visited with the pinch flex[/dt]
  [dd]
  Use a Greek prefix followed by a hyphen,
  e.g. *tri-hexaflexagon" for the 3-faced hexaflexagon.
  [br/][br/]
  Note that I suggest this because it's widely used, though it's often not unique
  (e.g. there are 3 different triangle hexa-hexaflexagons)
  and doesn't apply to flexagons whose generating sequence has flexes other than the pinch flex.
  [/dd]
[/dl]

[a name:'flexes'/]
# Flexes

[dl]
  [dt]Flexes used in publications[/dt]
  [dd]
  Pinch flex, v-flex, box flex, pass-through, reverse pass-through, snap flex, twist flex, interleaf flex
  [/dd]

  [dt]Flexes I've used for triangle flexes[/dt]
  [dd]
  Pocket flex, tuck, pyramid shuffle, flip, silver tetra, various slots, ticket, and variations of the pinch flex.
  [br/][br/]
  See the [Flex Compendium](flex-compendium.html) for a longer list.
  [/dd]

  [dt]Notation[/dt]
  [dd]
  For use in *flex notation*, each flex gets assigned shorthand to uniquely identify it.
  A flex's shorthand starts with a capital letter, alternately followed by one or more lower case letters or numbers,
  e.g. `P`, `S`, `P333`.
  There are additional modifiers that can be added to the flex shorthand:
* `'` for inverse, e.g. `P'`
* `+` to indicate that the necessary internal structure should be created in the flexagon, e.g. `P+`
* `*` is the equivalent of `+` followed by applying the flex, e.g. `P* = P+ P`
  `>`, `<`, `^` are special symbols that indicate rotating the flexagon or turning it over to change the *current vertex*.
  [/dd]

# Describing a specific flexagon and template

## Conrad & Hartline

The [Conrad & Hartline paper](http://delta.cs.cinvestav.mx/~mcintosh/comun/flexagon/flexagon.html)
describes every leaf in a template using +'s and -'s to tell you which edge to reflect the next leaf over
plus numbers on the front and back of each leaf.
The numbers also indicate how to fold the flexagon.
If you add in the angles of the leaf polygon, this gives a complete description of a unique flexagon.

See [Maps and Plans](http://delta.cs.cinvestav.mx/~mcintosh/comun/flexagon/node5.html)
and [Proper Flexagons](http://delta.cs.cinvestav.mx/~mcintosh/comun/flexagon/node10.html)
for discussion.

## Flexagonator script

A [Flexagonator script](https://github.com/loki3/flexagonator/blob/master/docs/script.md)
has a couple different ways to describe a specific triangle flexagon.
A unique template can be derived from these descriptions.

You can specify the angles of a leaf by listing the angle in the center of the flexagon
followed by the angle clockwise from the center on the first leaf.
If the angles aren't specified, it's assumed to be an isosceles triangle flexagon
with a central angle chosen such that the *main position* lies flat.

One option is to specify the number of *pats* in the *main position* and a *generating sequence*.

```javascript
[
  { "numPats": 6 },
  { "flexes": "(P*^>)5" },
  { "angles": [60, 30] }
]
```

Another option is to describe the internal structure of one state of the flexagon using *pat notation*.

```javascript
[
  { "pats": [[1, 2], 3, 4, 5, [[[6, 7], 8], 9], 10] }
]
```

# Flexagon definition

Papers and publications on flexagons generally start out with a vague description of what a flexagon is,
perhaps include the story of who first discovered them,
and follow that with a discussion of some specific aspects.
But I don't recall having seen a good definition of exactly what a flexagon is
and how it differs from related mechanical paper folding constructs.

Here are my definitions from my G4G10 paper on [Flex Theory](http://loki3.com/flex/g4g10/Flex-Theory.pdf):

[dl]
  [dt]leaf[/dt]
  [dd]
  A single polygon
  [/dd]

  [dt]f-linkage[/dt]
  [dd]
  A chain of leaves where every leaf is connected along exactly two edges to mirror images of itself
  [/dd]

  [dt]pat[/dt]
  [dd]
  A portion of an f-linkage where the leaves are folded along edges such that the mirrored edges of the leaves all align
  [/dd]

  [dt]leaf splitting[/dt]
  [dd]
  Consider a leaf l[sub]0[/sub] in a pat.
  Itâ€™s connected to leaf l[sub]1[/sub] across edge e[sub]1[/sub] and to leaf l[sub]2[/sub] across edge e[sub]2[/sub],
  leaving its third edge e[sub]3[/sub] unconnected.
  If you think of the leaf as having a small amount of thickness, you can slice it in two,
  leaving the two new leaves connected across e[sub]3[/sub].
  One of the new leaves is connected across e[sub]1[/sub] to l[sub]1[/sub] while the other is connected across e[sub]2[/sub] to l[sub]2[/sub].

  There are two ways to perform this leaf splitting,
  with either the top leaf connected across e[sub]1[/sub] and the lower leaf across e[sub]2[/sub] or vice versa.
  The choice you make for the first leaf splitting operation determines the handedness of the flexagon.
  Every leaf splitting operation thereafter must use the same handedness; otherwise you no longer have a valid flexagon.
  [/dd]

  [dt]flexagon[/dt]
  [dd]
  An f-linkage of pats where every pat and sub-pat has been created through leaf splitting and has the same handedness
  [/dd]
[/dl]

I also referred to [Maps and Plans](http://delta.cs.cinvestav.mx/~mcintosh/comun/flexagon/node5.html)
in the Conrad & Hartline paper for more discussion around leaf splitting.
