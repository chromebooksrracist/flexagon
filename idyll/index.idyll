Here is a flexagon:

Change the number of pats per side of the flexagon:

Here's the unfolded strip.
[Button onClick:` showFoldingHelp = !showFoldingHelp `]Show/hide folding instructions.[/Button]
[Conditional if:` showFoldingHelp `]
  [Aside]
  **Cut:**
  Start by printing out the strip and cutting along the outside edges.

  **Prefold:**
  After you've cut out the shape, fold and unfold along every dashed line to prepare it.
  Note that the first and last triangle in the strip have dashed lines to indicate where to tape the edges after folding.

  **Number:**
  The large number on each triangle represents the number on the *front* of the triangle, while the small number represents the number on the *back*.
  Copy the small number from each triangle onto the back.

  **Fold:**
  Find the largest pairs of adjacent numbers and fold those numbers together.
  Then find the next largest pairs of adjacent numbers and fold them together.
  Continue in this way until the only numbers still visible are the 1's and the 2's.

  **Tape:**
  You should now have a hexagon consisting of 6 equilateral triangles.
  Tape the edges of the first and last triangles together to complete the flexagon.
