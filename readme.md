# Flexagonator

*Flexagonator* is a flexagon simulator.
Flexagons are origami-like puzzles folded from strips of paper, which can then be "flexed" into a variety of kaleidoscopic arrangements.
At their simplest, you can easily cycle through various states.
At their most complex, it can be more challenging than a Rubik's Cube(tm) to get them back to their original state.

Some of its features:

* Supports a wide variety of triangle flexagons, from 4 triangles a side to 12 a side or more, made up of any shape of traingle
* Displays the flexagon, the visible leaves, and information about the internal structure
* Figures out which flexes are possible and allows you to interactively pick flexes to perform
* Creates new flexagons using "flex generating sequences" for generating the structure necessary to perform the given flexes
* Displays the unfolded strip of paper corresponding to the current flexagon
* Searches for all the states accessible given a specified set of flexes
